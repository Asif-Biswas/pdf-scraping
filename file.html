    <h1 class="pretitle"><strong>Foreword</strong></h1>

    <p class="noindent">Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a threat to global health and development and is estimated to contribute to more than five million deaths globally each year. We need urgent global action, using a One Health approach, to keep our precious medicines working. One of the critical health targets of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals is for access to safe, effective and affordable medicines for all. In the case of antibiotics and other antimicrobials, using them carefully is vital to maintaining their effectiveness.</p>

    <p class="noindent">The inappropriate use and overuse of antibiotics are driving a global increase in AMR and have a pernicious impact on the effectiveness of these critical medicines. It threatens to send us back to the pre-antibiotic era, when a routine infection could mean death. Through the Global Action Plan on AMR, WHO is working to improve the surveillance of antimicrobial resistance and reduce inappropriate antibiotic consumption.</p>

    <p class="noindent">The new AWaRe antibiotic book, produced as an adjunct to WHO’s Essential Medicines List (EML), provides concise, evidence-based guidance for more than 30 of the most common clinical infections in children and adults in both primary health care and hospital settings. The EML has been a key strategic component of WHO’s goal to improve the use of medicines since 1977. The latest version of the EML, published in 2021, includes 39 antibiotics out of 479 medicines, reflecting the vital role these medicines play in health care.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Given the urgency of the threat to human health from AMR, and the many clinical infections for which antibiotics play a lifesaving role, WHO took a pragmatic approach to developing simple, practical guidance on how they should be used. The AWaRe system groups the hundreds of different antibiotics used globally into three simple categories – Access, Watch and Reserve – based on their clinical importance and the risk of their use promoting resistance. The AWaRe antibiotic book provides clear guidance on the choice of antibiotic, formulation, dose and duration for essential antibiotics for hospital and primary health care settings, including guidance on when not to use antibiotics.</p>

    <p class="noindent">There is an urgent need to develop and implement clear, globally accepted indicators, building on the AWaRe system, to promote the appropriate use of antibiotics and reduce their inappropriate use. Many challenges remain, including how data should inform local policies, and how to change patterns of medicine use formed over decades, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.</p>

    <p class="noindent">The 2022 AWaRe book is an important step along the road towards the improved use of antibiotics in humans, the development of stronger AMR policy and better clinical care.</p>

    <h1 class="pretitle"><strong>Glossary</strong></h1>

    <p class="H5---A"><strong>Antibiotic resistance</strong></p>

    <p class="noindent">Antibiotic resistance is a subset of antimicrobial resistance that specifically refers to bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics (medicines that act against bacteria).</p>

    <p class="H5---B"><strong>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR)</strong></p>

    <p class="noindent">AMR is the ability of bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites to resist the effects of antimicrobial medicines that kill susceptible organisms or keep them from growing.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Antimicrobial resistance predates the use of antimicrobials in human medicine and many bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites are intrinsically resistant to some antimicrobials. Microorganisms can also acquire resistance by being exposed to antimicrobials.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Infection with antimicrobial-resistant pathogens makes infections harder to treat and increases the risk of disease spread, severe illness and death.</p>

    <p class="H5---B"><strong>Antiseptics</strong></p>

    <p class="noindent">Antiseptics are antimicrobial products used to slow or stop the growth of microorganisms. They are usually used on the skin or mucous membranes, for example, the mouth. These include, for example, chlorhexidine. These products can be used as hand rubs, hand or mouth washes and skin preparations.</p>

    <p class="H5---B"><strong>Access, Watch and Reserve (AWaRE) classification</strong></p>

    <p class="noindent">AWaRe is the WHO classification of antibiotics introduced by WHO as part of the 2017 Model List of Essential Medicines.</p>

    <p class="noindent">In the AWaRe classification, there are three categories of antibiotics:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Access antibiotics that have a narrow spectrum of activity and a good safety profile in terms of side-effects.</li>

      <li>Watch antibiotics that are broader-spectrum antibiotics and are recommended as first-choice options for patients with more severe clinical presentations or for infections where the causative pathogens are more likely to be resistant to Access antibiotics.</li>

      <li>Reserve antibiotics that are last-choice antibiotics used to treat multidrug-resistant infections.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="noindent">This classification can be used to give an indirect indication of the appropriateness of antibiotic use. The World Health Organization (WHO) has defined a target that at least 60% of global antibiotic consumption at the national level should be from the Access group.</p>

    <p class="H5---B"><strong>Carbapenemases</strong></p>

    <p class="noindent">Carbapenemases are beta-lactamases, enzymes that can break the beta-lactam ring (an essential component of beta-lactam antibiotics) and make penicillins, cephalosporins, monobactams and carbapenems ineffective.</p>

    <p class="H5---B"><strong>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)</strong></p>

    <p class="noindent">COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-2). The first human cases of COVID-19 were reported in December 2019.</p>

    <p class="H5---B"><strong>C-reactive protein</strong></p>

    <p class="noindent">C-reactive protein is a laboratory test used to detect inflammation as an indicator of various conditions, including bacterial infection, and to monitor response to treatment.</p>

    <p class="H5---B"><strong>Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)</strong></p>

    <p class="noindent">DALYs are an indicator used to assess the overall burden of disease. It is a time-based measure that combines years of life lost due to premature mortality and years of healthy life lost due to disability. One DALY represents the loss of the equivalent of one year of full health.</p>

    <p class="H5---B"><strong>Model List of Essential In Vitro Diagnostics</strong></p>

    <p class="noindent">The WHO Model List of Essential In Vitro Diagnostics (or Essential Diagnostics List (EDL)) is a list of in vitro diagnostics that are recommended by WHO and that was first published in 2018. The EDL can be used as a reference for programme and laboratory managers, and procurement and reimbursement officers who are developing or updating their own national lists of essential diagnostics The list is updated every one to two years based on proposed additions and changes submitted to WHO by stakeholders and reviewed by the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on In Vitro Diagnostics (SAGE-IVD).</p>

    <p class="H5---B"><strong>Enzyme immunoassay</strong></p>

    <p class="noindent">An enzyme immunoassay is a laboratory test that uses enzyme-labelled antibodies and antigens to detect biologic molecules.</p>

    <p class="H5---B"><strong>WHO Model List of Essential Medicines</strong></p>

    <p class="noindent">The WHO Model List of Essential Medicines (or Essential Medicines List (EML)) is a list of those medicines that satisfy the priority health care needs of the population. The first EML was published in 1977. The EML includes the most efficacious, safe and cost-effective medicines for priority conditions, selected on the basis of current and estimated future public health relevance, evidence of effectiveness and safety, and cost–effectiveness. The EML is updated every 2 years based on proposed additions and changes submitted to WHO by stakeholders and reviewed by the WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines.</p>

    <p class="H5---B"><strong>WHO Model List of Essential Medicines for Children</strong></p>

    <p class="noindent">The WHO Model List of Essential Medicines for Children (or Essential Medicines List for Children (EMLc)) is a list of those medicines that satisfy the priority health care needs for children up to 12 years of age. The first EMLc was published in 2007. The EML includes the most efficacious, safe and cost-effective medicines for priority conditions in children, selected on the basis of current and estimated future public health relevance, evidence of effectiveness and safety, and cost–effectiveness. The EMLc is updated every 2 years based on proposed additions and changes submitted to WHO by stakeholders and reviewed by the WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines.</p>

    <p class="H5---B"><strong>Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs)</strong></p>

    <p class="noindent">ESBLs are a group of beta-lactamases, enzymes that can break the beta-lactam ring, which is an essential component of beta-lactam antibiotics, thus making penicillins, cephalosporins and monobactams (but not carbapenems) ineffective.</p>

    <p class="H5---B"><strong>Genotypic resistance</strong></p>

    <p class="noindent">Genotypic resistance is a type of resistance of an organism to an antibiotic or antibiotics due to genetic mutation and expression of resistance genes. It is determined by methods of antimicrobial susceptibility testing that detect resistance genes. This information may be important for choosing the correct antibiotic and for epidemiological and surveillance reasons.</p>

    <p class="H5---B"><strong>Glutamate dehydrogenase</strong></p>

    <p class="noindent">Glutamate dehydrogenase is a constitutive enzyme produced by all strains of <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> and it is easily detected in stool samples.</p>

    <p class="H5---B"><strong>Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS)</strong></p>

    <p class="noindent">The GLASS is the WHO surveillance system for antimicrobial resistance and use launched in 2015 to collect official national data in selected bacterial pathogens causing common infections in humans</p>

    <p class="H5---B"><strong>Intramuscular</strong></p>

    <p class="noindent">Route of administration of an injection to deliver a medication deep into the muscles.</p>

    <p class="H5---B"><strong>Intravenous</strong></p>

    <p class="noindent">Route of administration of an injection or infusion to deliver a medication into a vein.</p>

    <p class="H5---B"><strong>Methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA)</strong></p>

    <p class="noindent">MRSA are strains of <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> that are resistant to methicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics due to the presence of the <em>mecA</em> (or sometimes <em>mecC</em>) gene which produces a different penicillin-binding protein with lower affinity for beta-lactam antibiotics.</p>

    <p class="H5---B"><strong>Microbiota</strong></p>

    <p class="noindent">Microbiota is a collective term for the microorganisms that live in or on the human body.</p>

    <p class="H5---B"><strong>Nucleic acid amplification test</strong></p>

    <p class="noindent">Nucleic acid amplification is a laboratory test used to detect a particular nucleic acid sequence to identify virus or bacteria in different biological samples. There are several ways of amplification, one of the most commonly used is the polymerase chain reaction.</p>

    <p class="H5---B"><strong>Non-fermenters</strong></p>

    <p class="noindent">Non-fermenters are bacteria that cannot catabolize glucose and thus are unable to ferment. The most relevant in this context are <em>Acinetobacter baumannii</em> and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>.</p>

    <p class="H5---B"><strong>Phenotypic resistance</strong></p>

    <p class="noindent">Phenotypic resistance is a type of resistance determined by methods of antimicrobial susceptibility testing such as disk diffusion, broth microdilution and agar dilution and considered the reference standard for detection of antibiotic resistance. Susceptibility/resistance is determined based on the ability of defined concentrations of antibiotics to inhibit growth. It can generally not determine the cause of the resistance (e.g. beta-lactamases versus efflux pumps), information that may be relevant for choosing the correct antibiotic.</p>

    <p class="H5---B"><strong>Pharmacodynamics</strong></p>

    <p class="noindent">Pharmacodynamics are the molecular, biochemical and physiological effects of medicines and their mechanisms of action – what the medicine does to the body.</p>

    <p class="H5---B"><strong>Pharmacokinetics</strong></p>

    <p class="noindent">Pharmacokinetics is the dynamics of absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination of medicines by the body – what the body does to the medicine.</p>

    <p class="H5---B"><strong>Rapid diagnostic tests</strong></p>

    <p class="noindent">Rapid diagnostic tests are diagnostic assays designed for use at the point of care.</p>

    <p class="noindent">There is a clear need for simple resources to improve the quality of antibiotic prescribing globally. The AWaRe book was designed as a tool to make the antibiotics section of the World Health Organization (WHO) Model List of Essential Medicines (EML) and Model List of Essential Medicines for Children (EMLc) more helpful to prescribers and to update the 2001 <em>WHO model prescribing information (1)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Aim and scope</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">The aim of the AWaRe book is to provide short, clinical guidance on the management of common infections, including recommendations for empiric antibiotic treatment at the first clinical presentation and when a “no antibiotic” approach is appropriate. Guidance is given on the choice of antibiotics that should be used to treat the most likely bacterial pathogens causing each infection in adults and children, the dosage and the treatment duration.</p>

    <p>The AWaRe book is intended for all health care workers who prescribe and dispense antibiotics in high-, middle- and low-income settings in both the primary health care and the facility/hospital setting. It aims to complement the <em>WHO policy guidance on integrated antimicrobial stewardship activities</em> and the toolkit for health care facilities in low- and middle-income countries <em>(2,3)</em>. The AWaRe book is not intended to replace existing local and national antibiotic prescribing guidelines and clinical judgment, but to provide simple guidance where currently none is available.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Methods</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">The antibiotic treatment recommendations outlined in the AWaRe book are based on reviews of the evidence undertaken for the 2017, 2019 and 2021 updates of the EML and EMLc. The EML and EMLc provide a list of safe and effective antibiotics that should be available and affordable for patients globally. The AWaRe book provides guidance on how to best use these antibiotics based on the principles of the Access, Watch and Reserve (AWaRe) framework (Box 1.1).</p>

    <div class="box_azul">
      <p class="box_tit"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_2" title="2" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong><a id="Box1.1"/>Box 1.1 – Principles of the AWaRe framework</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li class="box_li">Maximizing clinical effectiveness</li>

        <li class="box_li">Minimizing toxicity</li>

        <li class="box_li">Minimizing unnecessary costs to patients and health care systems</li>

        <li class="box_li">Reducing the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance (i.e. prioritizing antibiotics that are less likely to lead to antibiotic resistance in an individual patient and the community)</li>

        <li class="box_li">Parsimony (i.e. avoiding the inclusion of many similar antibiotics)</li>

        <li class="box_li">Simplification (i.e. same Access antibiotic recommended for multiple indications)</li>

        <li class="box_li">Alignment with existing WHO guidelines</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>The detailed reviews on the optimal choice of antibiotics to be used for each specific clinical infection were based on a standardized analysis of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and clinical practice guidelines by experts in evidence-based medicines from McMaster University (Hamilton, Canada).</p>

    <p>Details of the evidence underlying the recommendations and the methodology can be found in the following publications:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>The selection and use of essential medicines: report of the WHO Expert Committee, 2017</em>. WHO technical report series; 1006 <em>(4)</em>.</li>

      <li><em>The selection and use of essential medicines: report of the WHO Expert Committee on Selection and Use of Essential Medicines, 2019</em>. WHO technical report series; 1021 <em>(5)</em>.</li>

      <li><em>The selection and use of essential medicines: report of the WHO Expert Committee on Selection and Use of Essential Medicines, 2021</em>. WHO technical report series; 1035 <em>(443)</em>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The choice of antibiotics to use for each specific infection are formal recommendations based on the evaluation made by the EML Expert Committee on the evidence presented for the EML updates or derived from existing WHO guidelines where available. The AWaRe book also provides guidance on diagnosis, symptomatic treatment and treatment duration based on non-systematic reviews of the literature and expert opinion. Some factors to be considered when using the AWaRe book are outlined in Box 1.2.</p>

    <div class="box_azul">
      <p class="box_tit"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_3" title="3" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong><a id="Box1.2"/>Box 1.2 – General considerations about the use of the AWaRe book</strong></p>

      <p class="box_p">As with any general guidance document, the individual circumstances of the patients need to be considered. Comorbidities (e.g. immunosuppression which changes the pathogens that need to be considered, or renal or hepatic insufficiency which may require dose adaption of antibiotics), concomitant medications (risk of interactions), pregnancy and breastfeeding status (some antibiotics may be contraindicated), allergies (see the chapter on allergies to antibiotics) and national regulations all may require an adaption of the guidance and <strong>it is the responsibility of each prescriber to make sure that all these considerations are taken into account when prescribing an antibiotic</strong>.</p>

      <p class="box_p">Patients should be informed about the most common side-effects of the antibiotic, how it should be stored and taken, how long to take it for and what to do if symptoms worsen or fail to improve and how leftover antibiotics should be properly disposed of.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Structure</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">There are separate chapters for 35 infections, divided for ease of use into primary health care and hospital facility sections fully acknowledging that there is overlap between these groups.</p>

    <p>Each chapter on a clinical infection includes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Background information</strong>. The pathophysiology, epidemiology, global burden, most common pathogens and how to make the clinical diagnosis, including assessing disease severity.</li>

      <li><strong>Diagnostic tools</strong>. As the availability of diagnostic tools varies considerably in different settings, the empiric antibiotic recommendations are based on clinical signs and symptoms. Relevant diagnostic tests (including imaging and laboratory tests) are suggested based on <em>WHO Model List of Essential In Vitro Diagnostics</em> (EDL) <em>(6)</em>. The list of tests provided for each infection is not based on a formal assessment of their predictive value, but as a general guide of tests that could be clinically helpful, where available.</li>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Background</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">About 90% of all antibiotics are taken by patients in the primary health care setting. It is estimated that around half of all antibiotic use is inappropriate in some way, such as: the use of an antibiotic when none is indicated; the choice of an antibiotic with unnecessarily broad spectrum (e.g. Watch instead of Access antibiotics; see the following section); and the wrong dose, duration of treatment, and delivery or formulation of the antibiotic <em>(7)</em>.</p>

    <div class="box_amarelo">
      <p class="box_tit"><img src="../Images/notes_icon.jpg" alt="Imagem"/> <strong>Note</strong></p>

      <p class="box_p">The term antibiotic stewardship is preferred to antimicrobial stewardship and is used throughout the AWaRe book to acknowledge the fact that the book only provides guidance on antibiotic treatment.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><span class="verde">A</span><span class="amarelo">Wa</span><span class="vermelho">Re</span><strong/></h2>

    <p class="noindent">The AWaRe book gives guidance on first- and second-choice antibiotics for common infections in line with the recommendations in the EML and EMLc <em>(8,9)</em>. WHO has classified antibiotics into four groups, Access, Watch, Reserve (AWaRe) and a fourth – Not Recommended – group. As well as the antibiotics in the EML and EMLc, more than 200 other antibiotics have now been classified into AWaRe groups to help inform local and national policy development and implementation <em>(10)</em>.</p>

    <p><span class="verde"><strong>Access</strong></span> antibiotics have a narrow spectrum of activity, lower cost, a good safety profile and generally low resistance potential. They are often recommended as empiric first- or second-choice treatment options for common infections (see Box 2.1 for WHO’s target for their use).</p>

    <p><span class="amarelo"><strong>Watch</strong></span> antibiotics are broader-spectrum antibiotics, generally with higher costs and are recommended only as first-choice options for patients with more severe clinical presentations or for infections where the causative pathogens are more likely to be resistant to Access antibiotics, such as upper urinary tract infections (UTIs).</p>

    <p><span class="vermelho"><strong>Reserve</strong></span> antibiotics are last-choice antibiotics used to treat multidrug-resistant infections (see chapter on Reserve antibiotics).</p>

    <p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_6" title="6" role="doc-pagebreak"/>The AWaRe system is also represented as a traffic-light approach: Access = green, Watch = orange and Reserve = red. Simple graphics using the traffic light approach can be used to show the proportions of Access and Watch antibiotics used in settings such as a community clinic or pharmacy or as part of central monitoring of antibiotic consumption.</p>

    <p>Countries, regions and districts are encouraged to use the AWaRe book as a basis for developing their own quality indicators and targets for safely reducing total levels of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing to improve patient safety and care, while reducing resistant infections and costs for patients and health systems (see Box 2.2 for goals of the AWaRe book).</p>

    <p class="noindent">Most infections encountered in primary health care are not caused by bacteria (e.g. most respiratory tract infections have a viral cause) and therefore the patient will not benefit from antibiotic treatment (Table 2.1). Even when the cause of the infection is bacterial, many infections are frequently self-limiting, with a low risk of severe complications and the benefit of antibiotics is limited, shortening of the duration of symptoms by usually only around 1 or 2 days. Most otherwise healthy patients with mild infections may safely receive symptomatic treatment alone, such as anti-inflammatory medicines, pain killers or complementary medicines. Whenever appropriate, guidance on diagnosing mild infections that can be treated with <em>No Antibiotic Care</em> is given in the AWaRe book.</p>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Are antibiotics needed?</h3>

    <p class="noindent">In 2006, WHO proposed that the percentage of patients attending a primary health care facility receiving an antibiotic should be less than 30% <em>(13)</em>. However, on average, around half of patients presenting with any infection in primary care still receive an antibiotic, thus contributing to the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) <em>(14)</em>. It is therefore important that both health care professionals and patients consider the risks of taking antibiotics when they are not needed. These risks include the immediate risk of side-effects of the medicine, most commonly diarrhoea or allergic reactions (such as a rash; see chapter on allergy to antibiotics) and rarely more serious side-effects. Bacteria in patients prescribed an antibiotic for a respiratory infection or a UTI – as examples of infections for which antibiotics are often prescribed – commonly develop antibiotic resistance to the prescribed (and other) antibiotics. These patients are also more likely to transmit resistant bacteria to other people <em>(14)</em>. Patients with infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria are more likely to have a delayed clinical recovery <em>(15)</em>. Furthermore, antibiotic treatment alters the patient’s microbiota (i.e. all microorganisms that live in or on the human body), with potential long-term consequences and an increased risk of infection by <em>Clostridioides difficile</em>, a bacterium that can cause severe diarrhoea.</p>

      </ol>
    </div>

    <p>The AWaRe book therefore aims to address one of the objectives of the WHO global action plan “Optimize the use of antimicrobial medicines” with a focus on antibacterial medicines or antibiotics (antimicrobials also include antifungal, antiviral and antiprotozoal medicines). The AWaRe book provides guidance on when not to prescribe antibiotics and, if indicated, which antibiotics to prescribe for the most common infections. The AWaRe book focusses on the optimal use of Access antibiotics as they remain the first-choice options for most infections.</p>

    <p>The AWaRe book recommends that nine of the 10 most common infections seen in primary health care can be treated safely with either no antibiotics or Access antibiotics (Table 2.2). Only one infection, acute bloody diarrhoea (dysentery), requires the empiric treatment with antibiotics in the Watch category, such as ciprofloxacin or azithromycin.</p>

    <p>The use of oral Watch antibiotics globally is increasing. They are now very commonly taken by patients in primary health care for minor infections (fever/cough/diarrhoea) in both high-income countries and low- and middle-income countries. Reducing the inappropriate use of both oral and intravenous Watch antibiotics is a critical strategy for the global control of antibiotic resistance, while ensuring vulnerable populations have continued or, where appropriate, improved access to Access antibiotics.</p>

        <li class="box_li">The wide use of fixed-dose combinations of antibiotics that are not compatible with the EML and not approved by the major regulatory agencies is of concern. Their use should be reduced as these combinations may result in increased toxicity and selection of resistance.</li>

        <li class="box_li">WHO has developed a list of fixed-dose combinations of antibiotics whose use is strongly discouraged <em>(10)</em>.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p class="noindent">In some countries, there is substantial use of fixed-dose combinations of antibiotics, which contain two or more agents in a single formulation. Recent data suggest that these combinations represent up to 20% of global antibiotic prescribing, especially in middle-income countries <em>(17)</em>. Some fixed-dose combinations of antibiotics are well established (e.g. sulfamethoxazole+trimethoprim) but other combinations often consisting of two or more broad-spectrum antibiotics, combined with antifungal and probiotic agents are of concern because they may contribute to the emergence and spread of AMR.</p>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Substandard and falsified medicinal antibiotics</h3>

    <p class="noindent">As antibiotics are the most common medicines used globally, the production and use of substandard and falsified medicinal antibiotics is a major problem. WHO estimates that up to one in 10 medical products in low- and middle-income country settings are substandard or falsified with antibiotics amongst the most commonly reported <em>(18)</em>. These products are typically found in informal market settings, which are a major source of antibiotics for patients globally, but also in less well-regulated pharmacies. All those involved in giving antibiotics to patients should take all reasonable steps to ensure that good quality medicinal products are provided, which are registered and licensed by the relevant national medicines regulatory authorities. Guidance on how to identify a possible problem of substandard and falsified medicinal antibiotics is provided in the WHO publication: <em>Substandard and falsified medical products</em> <em>(18)</em>.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Community health care workers</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Community health care workers include informal health care providers, that is providers with no or limited formal training. In rural areas in low- and middle-income country settings, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_17" title="17" role="doc-pagebreak"/>they are often the first medical contact for many people in the community. Antibiotics are commonly prescribed by these informal providers, including the inappropriate prescription of broad-spectrum antibiotics or frequent prescription of antibiotics to treat upper respiratory tract infections that are often of viral origin <em>(19)</em>.</p>

    <p>Improved antibiotic use could be helped by further education of this sector with a focus on the optimal use of Access antibiotics. Educational activities and training on how to manage common infections using the AWaRe book could be considered, for example, to decrease the use of oral Watch antibiotics and limit the use of antibiotics for severe infections only.</p>

      </ul>
    </div>

    <p class="noindent">For each infection discussed in the AWaRe book, guidance is given for both children and adults on the dose of antibiotic to be prescribed, how often the dose should be taken, the route of administration of the antibiotic and the duration of antibiotic treatment.</p>

    <p>The guidance is based on: (i) existing WHO guidelines, (ii) a review of recent literature, (iii) a review of recent guidelines from different WHO regions and (iv) expert opinion (the EML Antimicrobial Working Group).</p>

    <p>Users of the AWaRe book should be aware of the limited evidence underlying many antibiotic prescribing strategies, particularly the very poor evidence for dosing guidance for older antibiotics (when approval processes were less stringent and methods to determine <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_18" title="18" role="doc-pagebreak"/>pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic target attainment less developed), which may explain some of the variation in international recommendations. The AWaRe book therefore does not provide formal recommendations for dosage, frequency of use, route of administration and duration, but rather provides general guidance on what would be considered appropriate dosing strategies and duration in most clinical cases.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Dosing</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Wherever appropriate the same dose is given for each antibiotic for all infections to help local procurement and prescribing. In the hospital facility section, guidance is also given on when to consider <strong>step down</strong> from intravenous to oral antibiotics, encouraging the early discharge of patients from hospital when clinically appropriate.</p>

    <p>Guidance on dose adjustments for abnormal kidney and liver function is not covered, and the summary of product characteristics should be consulted. In addition, detailed information on antibiotic administration, for example, the use of continuous or prolonged infusion times of beta-lactams in multidrug-resistant infections, is not covered as this is beyond the scope of the AWaRe book <em>(21,22)</em>.</p>

    <p>Even though this dosing is not covered in the AWaRe book, higher doses or more frequent administration may be required in certain situations such as: patients with very severe infections (including sepsis / septic shock) or infections of certain body sites such as infections of the central nervous system; patients with significant underlying disease (e.g. severe immunosuppression); and overweight patients.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Dosing in children</h3>

    <p class="noindent">For children, weight-based dosing was generally used for oral treatments based on WHO ranges. For children weighing more than 30 kg, adult dosing should be considered. The 2019 EML report on consensus guidance on paediatric dosing regimens was used as a reference but adapted by infection and severity of disease <em>(20)</em>.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Treatment duration</h3>

    <p class="noindent">For treatment duration, where there was an acceptable range for the duration of therapy, the lowest number of days supported by the review of guidelines and expert opinion is used.</p>

    <p>Strong evidence-based guidance on the most appropriate duration of treatment for many infections is limited. Therefore, duration is often individualized based on clinical response, on the success of surgical source control and, if available, changes in laboratory markers of infection. When an alternative diagnosis is established which does not require antibiotics, antibiotic treatment should be stopped. Shorter treatment where clinically appropriate is generally associated with less toxicity and a lower risk of selection and transmission of antibiotic resistance, with equivalent clinical outcomes.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_19" title="19" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Intravenous or oral antibiotics</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Most non-severe infections can be safely treated with oral antibiotics and this approach is encouraged as it has several advantages, for example, less risk of line-associated infections and avoidance of hospitalizations. However, this is provided that there is no risk of poor enteral absorption (e.g. no vomiting) or need to treat pathogens for which effective oral options are not available, for example in the case of infections caused by certain multidrug-resistant pathogens.</p>

    <p>When intravenous treatment is started (e.g. for severe infections), rapid oral step down should be considered as soon as this can be safely done.</p>

        <li class="box_li">True severe allergy to antibiotics is rare and allergies are often over-reported</li>

        <li class="box_li">Beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillins and cephalosporins) of the Access group are among the most effective and safe medicines for many infections, and they should only be avoided when there is a high suspicion of true allergy.</li>

        <li class="box_li">Cephalosporins and carbapenems can be safely used in most cases of non-severe penicillin allergy.</li>

        <li class="box_li">All patients who are labelled as allergic should be carefully evaluated and their antibiotic allergy risk level should be determined.</li>

        <li class="box_li">Routine skin testing before prescribing a beta-lactam antibiotic (e.g. penicillin or amoxicillin) is not needed, and direct oral challenge can be performed in carefully selected low-risk phenotypes.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p class="noindent">The AWaRe book does not include alternative antibiotic options in cases of allergy to first-choice antibiotics. The reason for this is that a true allergy to antibiotics (true meaning an allergic reaction that is immune-mediated) is rare and the AWaRe book focuses on the empiric treatment options for most patients. Beta-lactam antibiotics of the Access group are among the most effective and safe medicines for many infections. Avoiding the use of this class, unless clearly justified because of severe allergy, exposes the patient to the risk of receiving suboptimal treatment for their infection.</p>

    <p>This chapter on allergy describes general principles of the mechanisms of allergies to antibiotics and the implications for treatment. From the perspective of antibiotic stewardship, it is important to avoid over-diagnosing antibiotic allergies. Such over-diagnosis often occurs with antibiotics in the Access category (e.g. with penicillins) and can lead to the subsequent prescription of antibiotics in the Watch category, for example, macrolides that may be less effective and less safe. The detailed management of allergic reactions is beyond the scope of this chapter.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Definitions</strong></h2>

    <ul>
      <li>An <strong>allergy</strong> is a reaction of the immune system to a “non-self” substance.</li>

      <li>An <strong>adverse reaction</strong> is a response to a medicine which is harmful and unintended, and which occurs at the doses normally used <em>(23)</em>. Most adverse <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_21" title="21" role="doc-pagebreak"/>reactions can be classified as type A or type B reactions (Table 3.1) depending on whether or not their effects are related to the primary mechanism of action of the medicine (type A, i.e. if they are predictable based on the mechanism of action or not) and also whether the immune system is involved (type B, i.e. hypersensitivity reactions) <em>(24)</em>. Most patients with type A adverse reactions (e.g. nausea, vomiting, headache and injection site reactions) should not be labelled as having a beta-lactam allergy, to prevent avoidance of beta-lactam antibiotics.</li>

      <li>A <strong>hypersensitivity reaction</strong> is any adverse reaction that is immunologically mediated. Hypersensitivity reactions are type B reactions and can be classified based on the timing of onset of symptoms after taking the antibiotic as well as on the underlying mechanism, that is, immediate reactions (potentially IgE-mediated) or delayed reactions (potentially T cell-mediated). Immediate reactions usually occur within 1–2 hours of taking the antibiotic and delayed reactions usually after more than 6–24 hours. Reactions occurring within 2–6 hours are often called accelerated.</li>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Epidemiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Allergies to medicines are frequently self-reported, especially for antibiotics <em>(25)</em> with 5–15% of patients in high-income countries reporting a penicillin allergy <em>(24)</em>. However, in most cases (&gt; 95%), these patients do not have a true immunologically mediated allergy and it is very likely that they can tolerate the antibiotic if re-exposed or challenged <em>(26)</em>.</p>

    <p>Severe allergies to antibiotics (e.g. anaphylactic shock) are rare; nonetheless, antibiotics are the most common cause of life-threatening immunologically mediated reactions <em>(24)</em>. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_22" title="22" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Allergy to antibiotics is often over-diagnosed and patients are frequently labelled in health records as allergic to certain antibiotics (particularly to beta-lactams and sulfonamides) based on an unverified, vague, unknown or old (e.g. &gt; 10 years) history of allergy reported by the patient, most often rashes. In most cases, these patients are unlikely to have a true allergy to the antibiotic and they will be able to safely tolerate it. Alternative explanations may exist for what the patients experienced previously, such as: (i) the antibiotic may have interacted with a concomitant infection, for example, antibiotic–infection interactions can occur in case of viral infections (e.g. the rash observed in patients with infectious mononucleosis caused by Epstein–Barr virus exposed to amoxicillin); or (ii) there may have been an “intolerance”/type A adverse reaction of the antibiotic manifested as, for example, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or headache; or (iii) a viral rash may have been confused with an allergic reaction. In addition, it is important to bear in mind that even true allergies are not always long-lasting and may decrease or disappear over time (&gt; 10 years) <em>(26)</em>.</p>

    <p>This over-diagnosis of allergy has important consequences because incorrectly labelling a patient as allergic to an antibiotic often results in the unnecessary use of alternative antibiotics. These alternatives may be less effective for the infection being treated and may expose the patient to other (sometimes more toxic) side-effects.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, most patients with a history of allergy to antibiotics are not evaluated to confirm the existence (or persistence) of the allergy.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Cross-reactivity</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Antibiotic cross-reactivity refers to the development of an allergic reaction to different substances that have a closely related structure, for example, cross-reactivity can occur between penicillin and other beta-lactams (Table 3.2) <em>(26–28)</em>, which may be due to an immunological reaction to the beta-lactam ring shared by these antibiotics.</p>

    <p>In patients with true allergy, cross-reactivity may occur and is generally predictable based on shared beta-lactam structures (e.g. R1 side chains), with the most frequently encountered example being aminopenicillins (e.g. amoxicillin, ampicillin) and aminocephalosporins such as cephalexin.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Clinical presentation</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Signs and symptoms of antibiotic allergy can vary in severity, ranging from mild reactions that can be safely managed in an outpatient setting with or without need for symptomatic treatment (e.g. antihistamines) to severe reactions that require hospitalization and even admission to intensive care. Immediate and delayed reactions can be severe or non-severe.</p>

    <p>Gastrointestinal symptoms and headache are not usually due to an allergic reaction but rather to an intolerance of the antibiotic that can vary in intensity from person to person or to <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> infection in case of diarrhoea.</p>

    <p>Most cases of allergic reactions to antibiotics are not severe and often present as mild skin reactions (most commonly mild rash, hives and itching) with no systemic symptoms.</p>

    <p>Severe reactions are rare but can become life-threatening. They can be immediate or delayed after administration of the antibiotic.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Immediate severe reactions should be suspected if there is airway involvement, bronchospasm, wheezing, angioedema (swelling of the tissue under the skin with or without hives) or anaphylaxis. Usually, these reactions develop fewer than 4 hours after taking the antibiotic.</li>

      <li>Delayed severe reactions should be suspected in patients who have taken an antibiotic and present with severe skin symptoms (e.g. a painful blistering rash) and fever, joint pain or signs of organ involvement (e.g. hepatitis). Thrombocytopenia <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_24" title="24" role="doc-pagebreak"/>(low platelet count), haemolytic anaemia (destruction of red blood cells) and signs and symptoms of hepatitis or nephritis in severe cases are suggestive of organ involvement. Usually, these reactions develop more than 24 hours after taking the antibiotic.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Allergy evaluation</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">All patients who are labelled as allergic should be carefully evaluated and their antibiotic allergy risk level should be determined. When evaluating a patient, a full history of their allergy should be taken from the patient with details of past reactions, including timing relative to antibiotic administration (immediate, intermediate, delayed or unknown) and treatment received (if any). Patients can be classified into three risk categories for allergy to antibiotics: low, moderate, and high risk; see Table 3.3 for examples but other assessment tools are also available <em>(29,30)</em>. Detailed documentation of all elements of the allergy is crucial. The patient should be educated about what types of antibiotics to avoid, if any, and should be provided, if possible, with written information such as a so-called allergy passport.</p>

In direct oral challenge tests, a single therapeutic dose of the antibiotic is given orally to the patient under medical supervision with the ability to treat acute allergic responses. The patient should be kept under observation (usually at least 1-2 hours) to check for objective signs of an allergic reaction. A detailed description of different types of tests available is beyond the scope of this chapter. Routine skin testing before prescribing a beta-lactam antibiotic (e.g. penicillin and amoxicillin) is not needed in children or adults and should not be recommended in guidelines as this is an unnecessary barrier to the use of Access antibiotics.</p>

    <p>In settings where allergy testing, specialist advice or treatment for anaphylaxis are not available, then pragmatic decisions should be based on a detailed history of any reported possible penicillin allergy. A rapid risk assessment needs to be done, including the medical importance of the infection the patient is presenting with (i.e. benefit–risk assessment in that patient and whether an antibiotic is really needed) and the availability of alternative antibiotics with similar effectiveness. Please see the relevant infection chapters and symptomatic non-antibiotic treatment of minor infections within chapters.</p>

    <p>Patients with a definite history of immediate collapse, breathing difficulties or severe facial swelling within a few minutes to 1–2 hours of taking a penicillin class of antibiotic are likely to have had a true anaphylactic reaction. If any alternative antibiotics are available, they are preferred. Patients who have only had gastrointestinal symptoms or a rash appearing a few days after receiving an antibiotic of the penicillin group and who have shown no signs of becoming seriously unwell are generally less likely to develop severe anaphylaxis if they receive such antibiotics again in the future. Therefore, if one of these antibiotics is the most appropriate and available treatment option, they can be given and the patient advised to stop it if they develop a new skin rash, especially if the onset is rapid, the rash is raised and itchy and/or accompanying symptoms are present such as shortness of breath.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Acute bronchitis is caused by tissue damage of the bronchial wall and inflammatory response triggered by the proliferation of microorganisms in the affected bronchi.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Epidemiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Acute bronchitis is a very common condition that can affect people of all ages, mostly during the seasons when respiratory viruses are common. Smoking and exposure to air pollution are risk factors. Acute bronchitis is one of the most common reasons for consultations in the primary health care setting and it is associated with frequent unnecessary use of antibiotics both in children and adults <em>(39–41)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Most likely pathogens</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">A causative pathogen is not identified in most cases of acute bronchitis. Most cases of acute bronchitis are of viral origin (Table 4.1).</p>

              <p class="legenda">Note. Nearly all cases of acute bronchitis have a viral origin. Only in a very small proportion of cases, are atypical pathogens (<em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em>, <em>Chlamydia pneumoniae</em>) involved.

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Clinical presentation</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Well-established clinical features of acute bronchitis include acute onset (less than 2 weeks) of cough lasting &gt; 5 days with or without sputum production (of note yellow/green sputum <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_33" title="33" role="doc-pagebreak"/>does not indicate a bacterial infection). Bronchitis is generally a mild condition with no tachycardia (i.e. no increased heart rate) or tachypnoea (i.e. no increased respiratory rate) and in most cases of acute bronchitis there is no fever. Cough usually persists for 10-20 days (around 1–3 weeks) but it can last longer.</p>

    <p>Because the predominant symptoms are cough with or without fever, these symptoms can overlap with the clinical picture of pneumonia. As a result, patients can be incorrectly diagnosed as having pneumonia in the initial assessment and are often therefore inappropriately treated with antibiotics. This misdiagnosis can be avoided with careful patient assessment to clearly differentiate the two infections.</p>

    <p>Usually, patients with pneumonia:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>are clinically unwell and with systemic signs of infection (e.g. fever, increased heart rate, increased respiratory rate or focal chest signs),</li>

      <li>are short of breath,</li>

      <li>have cough with sputum production.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Please refer to the chapter on community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) for the typical clinical presentation of patients with pneumonia.</p>

    <p>In patients with pre-existing chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), please refer to the chapter on this condition.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Laboratory tests</strong></h2>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Patient microbiology tests</h3>

    <p class="noindent">No microbiology test is usually required.</p>

    <p>During the influenza season or in case of outbreaks, a nasopharyngeal swab to test for influenza could be considered. Local policies should be followed as to whether during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic a nasopharyngeal swab or other sample (e.g. pharyngeal swab or saliva) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing (nucleic acid amplification test or rapid antigen test) should be obtained. Refer to the latest WHO guidelines for the management of patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Other tests</h3>

    <p class="noindent">In the great majority of cases of bronchitis, laboratory tests are not needed.</p>

    <p>In uncertain cases some experts advocate the use of biomarkers of infection (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin) to differentiate viral bronchitis from bacterial pneumonia, but these add costs and can also result in inappropriate prescribing due to the limited sensitivity and specificity of these tests.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_34" title="34" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Using microbiology surveillance data</h3>

    <p class="noindent">As antibiotics are not recommended no routine microbiology surveillance is required.</p>

    <p>Surveillance of circulating respiratory viruses can be useful to predict and follow epidemics and outbreaks, for example, SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Imaging</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Imaging is usually not needed.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>No antibiotic care</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Patients or parents should be informed about the natural course of acute bronchitis. It should be explained that the cough can persist for several weeks, often at night, the great majority of cases are self-limiting (and of viral origin) and there is no benefit from a course of antibiotic treatment. For symptomatic care for cold or mild influenza symptoms refer to Table 4.2. There is no clear evidence to support the usefulness of bronchodilators (in case of wheezing), or mucolytic or antitussive agents, but their use could be considered based on local practices and patient preferences.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Acute otitis media is an infection of the middle ear that occurs mostly in infants and children younger than 5 years, typically as a complication of a viral upper respiratory tract infection.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_40" title="40" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Pathogens that infect the middle ear come from the nasopharynx through the Eustachian tube usually following a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract. Inflammation and oedema cause narrowing of the tube and accumulation of mucosal secretions which favours growth of pathogens in the middle ear. This sequence of events triggers the typical signs and symptoms of otitis media.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Epidemiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Acute otitis media is very common in young children under 5 years of age with most experiencing at least one episode before the age of 3 years. Acute otitis media can complicate upper respiratory tract infections in up to a third of cases, especially in the first year of life <em>(43)</em>. The estimated global incidence of acute otitis media in 2017 was 317 million cases, for all ages and both sexes combined <em>(44)</em>. Children are more at risk of acute otitis media because their Eustachian tubes are narrower than those of an adult, which results in impaired drainage of fluids away from the middle ear. The incidence declines with age and adults are rarely affected. In countries where vaccination programmes against pneumococcal infection have been implemented, the incidence of acute otitis media among children has declined substantially <em>(45,46)</em>. In low- and middle-income countries, acute otitis media is still an important cause of hearing loss in children due to its progression into chronic suppurative otitis media when untreated <em>(47)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Most likely pathogens</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Several bacterial and/or viral respiratory pathogens are associated with acute otitis media (Table 5.1) <em>(48)</em>. Most cases of otitis media are triggered by infections with respiratory viruses (respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus and coronavirus), which can be complicated by superinfection with bacteria.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Amoxicillin has good activity against most isolates of <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>. Local patterns of susceptibility and individual risk factors should be considered when evaluating the possibility of an infection caused by isolates likely to be resistant to amoxicillin. Resistance is more likely in the case of recent exposure to amoxicillin (less than 3 months) or recurrent episodes (more than four episodes a year) of acute otitis media. Higher doses of amoxicillin are still active against most resistant strains of <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> and this antibiotic remains the treatment of choice.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Clinical presentation</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Typical signs and symptoms of acute otitis media include recent onset of ear pain (unilateral or bilateral), fever (≥ 38.0 °C) and at times, ear discharge.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Laboratory tests</strong></h2>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Patient microbiology tests</h3>

    <p class="noindent">In uncomplicated cases, microbiological tests are usually not needed and cultures of pus from perforated ear drums should not be used to guide treatment.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Other tests</h3>

    <p class="noindent">When acute otitis media is suspected clinically, blood tests are usually not needed (except in situations where complications such as mastoiditis are suspected).</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Using microbiology surveillance data</h3>

    <p class="noindent">There is no role for routine surveillance for resistant pathogens.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Otoscopy</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Otoscopy is required for a definitive diagnosis of acute otitis media. However, otoscopy or health care personnel with otoscopy skills may not be available in all settings.</p>

    <p class="noindent">In settings where otoscopy is available, classic findings include bulging, inflamed/congested tympanic membrane that may be opaque and show decreased mobility (Figure 5.1).</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Imaging</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">In uncomplicated cases, no imaging study is needed. If available, imaging (e.g. computed tomography (CT) scan) may be indicated only in situations where complications such as mastoiditis are suspected.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>No antibiotic care</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Most non-severe cases of acute otitis media can be managed symptomatically and do not require antibiotic treatment, especially in children older than 2 years.</p>

    <p>Non-severe cases usually have mild symptoms, often pain in one ear, and mild fever (&lt; 39.0 °C), which improves with antipyretics. A watchful waiting approach with symptomatic management (i.e. analgesics and antipyretics) is appropriate (Table 5.2). Watchful waiting involves careful monitoring of the child by caregivers, with instructions to seek care in case of worsening of fever, pain or persistence of the symptoms.</p>

    <p>The great majority of cases usually resolve spontaneously over a few days with no need for antibiotic treatment and the risk of complications (e.g. acute mastoiditis) is very low. Reassessment could be considered if symptoms do not improve over 3 days.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_51" title="51" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Viruses and bacteria responsible for pharyngitis gain access to the mucosal cells of the pharynx through different mechanisms and start replicating in these cells. Damage is caused to the cells where pathogens are replicating.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Epidemiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Sore throat is one of the most common conditions in patients presenting to primary health care and remains a very frequent cause of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing. Up to 60% of patients with sore throat are given antibiotics in many high-income outpatient settings <em>(55,56)</em>.</p>

    <p>Incidence and prevalence data on sore throat are unavailable for most low- and middle-income country settings. Most cases of pharyngitis are self-limiting and of viral origin. Cases of sore throat caused by bacteria (mostly <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em>) are rare and were responsible for about 10% of cases among patients with sore throat of all ages in a meta-analysis, but severe complications can occur <em>(57)</em>. These complications are either due to invasion of the organism in the pharynx (e.g. suppurative complications such as quinsy) or to an abnormal immunological response (e.g. acute rheumatic fever) <em>(58,59)</em>. Suppurative complications occur in a very small number of cases, are difficult to predict and most can be readily treated <em>(60,61)</em>. For this reason, the prevention of suppurative complications should not be considered an indication for antibiotic treatment in sore throat.</p>

    <p>Rheumatic fever is also a rare complication due to an autoimmune inflammatory reaction to untreated streptococcal pharyngitis; usually less than 3% of untreated cases of pharyngitis caused by <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em> trigger rheumatic fever in settings where this condition is endemic <em>(53,62)</em>. The incidence of rheumatic fever peaks between 5 and 15 years of age and is rare in people older than 30 years.</p>

    <p>When rheumatic fever develops, it usually presents (70–75% of cases) as an acute febrile illness with joint manifestations (e.g. pain or tenderness) and carditis. Less frequently, rheumatic fever can present as a predominantly neurological and/or behavioural disorder. Symptoms usually develop 2–3 weeks after the initial symptoms of pharyngitis are evident. Ultimately, rheumatic fever can result in damage to the heart valves (rheumatic heart disease). About 60% of people with rheumatic fever will develop rheumatic heart disease and the risk is two times higher for females than males.</p>

    <p>Despite the lack of data from many countries, 30 million people worldwide are thought to be affected by rheumatic heart disease, with an estimated 320 000 deaths in 2015 <em>(63)</em>.</p>

    <p>Cases of rheumatic fever are concentrated in the WHO African, South-East Asian and Western Pacific regions; these regions account for about 84% of cases. With 27% of all cases of rheumatic fever in 2015 India has the highest burden worldwide <em>(53)</em>.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Most (&gt; 80%) cases of pharyngitis are caused by a viral infection (respiratory viruses have been identified in 25–45% of cases; less frequently, the Epstein–Barr virus or other viruses of the herpesvirus family or SARS-CoV-2 are the cause). A minority of cases of pharyngitis are caused by bacteria, mainly <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em> (group A <em>Streptococcus</em>). Other streptococci (group C and G) have also been implicated as causes of pharyngitis (Table 6.1). Other infectious causes that need to be considered are acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as syphilis and gonorrhoea, acute toxoplasmosis and diphtheria – consider diphtheria if fever and greyish-white membranes covering the tonsil(s) are present in a child not vaccinated against diphtheria. Rarely, the cause of pharyngitis is non-infectious, for example, exposure to pollution, allergens and smoking.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Pharyngitis caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent"><em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em> is still universally very susceptible to penicillin. Resistance to penicillin has never been reported and there is no evidence of increasing minimal inhibitory concentrations. However, resistance to macrolides is common in some settings.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Clinical presentation</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Pharyngitis is characterized by sore throat and painful swallowing. Typical accompanying signs and symptoms can vary depending on the etiology. If the cause is viral, symptoms <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_53" title="53" role="doc-pagebreak"/>match those of a viral upper respiratory tract infection, and cough, headache and myalgia are likely to be present. If the cause is bacterial, a more severe presentation is usually seen, with fever (≥ 38.0 °C), tender cervical lymph nodes and pharyngeal exudates. Several clinical scoring systems have been developed to identify patients with higher likelihood of pharyngitis being caused by <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em>(see the next section).</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Scoring symptoms of pharyngitis</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">The specific cause of pharyngitis may be difficult to recognize based on symptoms alone. Scoring systems can help differentiate a viral infection from one of bacterial origin. The rationale is to help health care workers standardize the therapeutic approach and decide whether antibiotic treatment could be given based on the most likely etiology. However, scoring systems have a low specificity (i.e. high risk of incorrectly identifying patients with viral pharyngitis as having a <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em> infection) and can lead to unnecessary antibiotic treatment. Moreover, most systems have only been validated in high-income settings.</p>

    <p>One of the most widely used systems in the adult population is the Centor clinical scoring system (Table 6.2). However, even with the highest score of 4, the probability of an infection caused by <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em> is only 50% <em>(64)</em>.</p>

    <p>In low- and middle-income countries, other scores could be considered that have been specifically validated in these settings <em>(65)</em>.</p>

    <p class="noindent"><strong>Most cases of pharyngitis are of viral origin and do not benefit from antibiotics</strong>.</p>

    <p>When bacterial pharyngitis is suspected or proven, the decision to give antibiotic treatment is usually based on the likelihood of <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em> infection and on the local prevalence or patient history of rheumatic fever. Options to consider are given in Table 6.5. Second choice options reported in Table 6.5 should only be considered in patients allergic to first-choice options. In the case of clarithromycin, the prevalence of macrolide resistance in the setting where the patient acquired the infection should be considered since macrolide resistance among <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em> is high is certain countries.</p>

    <p>In general, patients will fall into one of the following two categories.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Patients treated in settings with a low prevalence of rheumatic fever. <strong>Antibiotic treatment is not needed in most cases</strong>. Antibiotics could be considered in some patients who have a high likelihood of pharyngitis caused by <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em> (i.e. Centor score 3–4). However, even with a Centor score of 3 or 4, antibiotic treatment is not necessary in most cases. Antibiotic treatment reduces sore throat pain only by around 1 day and the pain can alternatively be managed by regular analgesia. <br/>Antibiotic treatment could be discussed with patients or their caregivers on a case-by-case basis, weighing the benefits (e.g. reduced transmission and slight reduction in duration of symptoms) and risks (e.g. side-effects of antibiotics, effect on the intestinal microbiota) <em>(66)</em>. Relief of symptoms or prevention of suppurative complications is not considered an indication for antibiotic treatment. The rationale is that most suppurative complications are not severe and can be readily recognized and treated.</li>

      <li>Patients treated in settings with a medium to high prevalence of rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease or patients with a history of rheumatic fever or rheumatic heart disease. Antibiotic treatment is usually given if the likelihood of <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em> pharyngitis is high (i.e. Centor score 3–4). The rationale is to prevent rheumatic fever or its recurrence. However, after 21 years of age, the risk of rheumatic fever is usually lower.</li>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Definition</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Acute sinusitis is a symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. Most cases occur as a complication of a viral upper respiratory tract infection (e.g. a common cold caused by respiratory viruses such as rhinovirus) and symptoms can last up to 4 weeks. Acute sinusitis can also be associated with asthma, allergic rhinitis, smoking or exposure to smoke. This guidance applies mainly to maxillary sinusitis as this is the most common clinical condition.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_66" title="66" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Nasal congestion, usually triggered by an infection of the upper respiratory tract, can lead to obstruction of the sinus ostia with consequent hypoxia of the sinuses and mucus retention. Mostly the maxillary and the anterior ethmoid sinuses are involved. The inflammatory response that develops produces the signs and symptoms of acute sinusitis.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Epidemiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Upper respiratory tract infections are a common reason for consultations in an outpatient setting, both for children and adults. According to the 2017 Global Burden of Disease study, upper respiratory tract infections are one of the top three causes of new disease globally for all ages and both sexes combined – an estimated 17.1 billion cases are recorded a year <em>(44)</em>. Acute sinusitis accounts for 0.5% of all upper respiratory tract infections and is much more common in adults than in children whose sinuses are not fully developed.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Most available data are from high-income settings and show that antibiotics are frequently prescribed in cases of acute viral sinusitis <em>(7,41)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Most likely pathogens</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Acute sinusitis is usually caused by respiratory viruses; only a small percentage (usually less than 2%) of cases are complicated by bacterial infection (Table 7.1).</p>

    <p class="noindent">Amoxicillin has good clinical activity against the great majority of isolates of <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>. However, since the introduction of anti-pneumococcal vaccines, there is concern about increasing incidence of acute sinusitis caused by <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> and <em>Moraxella catarrhalis</em> and an increased incidence of beta-lactamase production among these strains that may result in amoxicillin resistance. Higher doses of amoxicillin are still active against most resistant strains of <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> and this antibiotic remains the treatment of choice.</p>

    <p>Local patterns of susceptibility and individual risk factors should be considered when evaluating the possibility of an infection caused by isolates likely to be resistant to amoxicillin.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Clinical presentation</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">The diagnosis of sinusitis is made based on clinical criteria and the time pattern; it is important to consider that symptoms of acute bacterial sinusitis and acute viral sinusitis overlap considerably. Symptoms usually last for 10–14 days and are self-limiting.</p>

    <p>The main symptoms of acute sinusitis are purulent nasal drainage, nasal obstruction or congestion, unilateral dental or facial pain, and facial fullness or pressure. Cough may also be present.</p>

    <p>The location of pain in sinusitis depends on which sinuses are affected. For example, pain can be localized on the forehead (frontal sinuses), over cheekbones/teeth/upper jaw (maxillary sinuses) or behind the nose (ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses).</p>

    <p>Acute bacterial sinusitis should be suspected in two situations:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>signs and symptoms persist without improvement for more than 10 days</li>

      <li>symptoms become significantly worse after an initial mild phase.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Yellow/green colour of nasal discharge alone is not a sign of bacterial infection and is not an indication for antibiotic treatment.</p>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Patient microbiology tests</h3>

    <p class="noindent">As the great majority of cases have no positive bacterial cultures, there is no role for routine surveillance to inform empiric guidance.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Imaging</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">When sinusitis is suspected clinically, imaging is not usually needed unless a complication or an alternative diagnosis is suspected.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>No antibiotic care</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">The goal of treatment is to improve symptoms. Antibiotics have only minimal effect on the duration of symptoms in most cases and current evidence suggests that even without antibiotic treatment, most cases in healthy patients resolve within 1–2 weeks <em>(69)</em>.</p>

    <p>Most guidelines recommend using disease severity (i.e. duration and intensity of symptoms) to direct treatment.</p>

    <p>In case of mild to moderate presentation (less than 10 days duration and improving symptoms), a watchful waiting approach with symptom relief and no antibiotic treatment is usually adequate. Symptoms should be managed with antipyretic and analgesic medications (Table 7.2). Nasal irrigation with a saline solution and topical intranasal glucocorticoids or decongestants may also be used to relieve symptoms, even though their effectiveness in relieving symptom is still uncertain <em>(70)</em>.</p>

    <p>The rationale of a watchful waiting approach is that in uncomplicated cases in adults, antibiotics (compared to no treatment) can shorten the duration of symptoms and improve the course of infection (e.g. resolution of purulent nasal discharge) only in a small percentage of patients. However, these potential benefits must be balanced against the risk of adverse events from antibiotics (e.g. gastrointestinal side-effects, allergic reaction and rash) and of increasing bacterial resistance <em>(69)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Antibiotic treatment</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent"><strong>Antibiotic treatment is not required in the great majority of cases of sinusitis</strong>.</p>

    <p>Antibiotic treatment could be considered in certain cases, such as severe onset of symptoms, patients with underlying comorbid diseases or in those at increased risk of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_70" title="70" role="doc-pagebreak"/>complications (see antibiotic options in Table 7.3). Severe onset is defined as fever ≥ 39.0 °C and purulent nasal discharge or facial pain for at least 3–4 consecutive days <em>(71)</em>. The decision to treat with antibiotics in patients with chronic comorbid diseases should always be made on a case-by-case basis. Relevant comorbid conditions to consider include chronic malignancies and immunodeficiency.</p>

    <p>Antibiotic treatment could also be considered in cases with “red flag” signs and symptoms suggestive of a complicated infection, such as systemic toxicity, persistent fever ≥ 39.0 °C, periorbital redness and swelling, severe headache and altered mental status.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Prevention</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Prevention of sinusitis is based on the prevention of upper respiratory tract infections. All strategies (e.g. hand and respiratory hygiene, influenza, pneumococcal and COVID-19 vaccines) that help prevent upper respiratory tract infections could be useful in preventing sinusitis, including vaccination against <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> and <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b for all children worldwide <em>(35,36)</em>. For countries considering vaccination programmes for influenza, vaccination of high-risk groups could be considered, for example, children aged 6 months to 5 years <em>(37)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Definition</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Various dental conditions and terms are defined below. The anatomy of a healthy tooth is illustrated in Figure 8.1.</p>

    <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_73" title="73" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Abscess:</strong>localized collection of pus caused by a bacterial infection in the tooth, gingivae (gums) or alveolar bone supporting the tooth. Abscesses can be categorized as:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>apical abscess, when the infection at the apex of the dental root originates from within the dental pulp. This is the most common form of dental abscess and usually results from untreated dental caries.</li>

      <li>periodontal abscess, where there is a collection of pus between the root and alveolar bone usually resulting from serious gum diseases.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="noindent"><strong>Alveolar bone:</strong> part of the jawbones which surrounds and supports the teeth.</p>

    <p class="noindent"><strong>Apical periodontitis:</strong> inflammation (associated with pain) within the alveolar bone around the apex of a tooth, often occurring as a consequence of a necrotic pulp following pulpitis, tooth fracture or trauma.</p>

    <p class="noindent"><strong>Dental caries:</strong> tooth decay.</p>

    <p class="noindent"><strong>Dental pulp:</strong> blood vessels and nerves within the inner part of the tooth.</p>

    <p class="noindent"><strong>Dry socket (alveolar osteitis):</strong> a recognized inflammatory complication of tooth extraction which may develop a few days after extraction, last for more than a week and is extremely painful.</p>

    <p class="noindent"><strong>Gingivae (gums):</strong> soft tissue covering the alveolar bone.</p>

    <p class="noindent"><strong>Necrotic pulp:</strong> An irreversible condition that occurs when the pulp within the tooth becomes non-vital (dies) and is often associated with apical periodontitis.</p>

    <p class="noindent"><strong>Noma (cancrum oris/gangrenous stomatitis):</strong> an acute necrotizing disease that destroys the soft tissues and bones of the mouth and face as it progresses from necrotizing periodontal disease (previously known as necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis), mostly in malnourished children living in extreme poverty and with weakened immune systems.</p>

    <p class="noindent"><strong>Pericoronitis:</strong> inflammation of the gingiva (gum) surrounding a partially erupted tooth, often a lower wisdom tooth, which may be associated with an infection.</p>

    <p class="noindent"><strong>Periodontal disease:</strong> a group of inflammatory diseases affecting the tissues that surround and support the teeth. This includes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Gingivitis:</strong> inflammation of the gingivae (gums).</li>

      <li><strong>Periodontitis:</strong> chronic inflammatory disease of bacterial etiology that affects the soft and hard tissues which support the tooth, including alveolar bone.</li>

      <li><strong>Necrotizing periodontal disease (previously known as necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis):</strong> a severe gum infection characterized by necrosis and ulcerations caused by a bacterial infection and often accompanied by severe pain and a strongly unpleasant smell.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_74" title="74" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Plaque:</strong>biofilm of microbes, mainly bacteria, which grows on surfaces within the mouth and contributes to oral diseases such as caries and periodontal disease.</p>

    <p class="noindent"><strong>Pulpitis:</strong> inflammation of the dental pulp causing pain. This condition often occurs as a result of the progression of dental caries and can lead to apical periodontitis which can then evolve into a dental abscess.</p>

    <p class="noindent"><strong>Spreading infection:</strong> development of sepsis or the spread of infection through the fascial spaces to vital structures of the head and neck (such as cellulitis) which can occur rapidly and become life-threatening.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Most dental conditions relate to the oral microbiota in dental plaque and do not require antibiotic treatment. Dental plaque is a microbe rich biofilm that sticks to surfaces within the mouth, including teeth, dentures and orthodontic appliances. In the presence of free sugars, especially sucrose from the diet, plaque bacteria can create an environment that favours tooth decay (dental caries). Acid produced by plaque bacteria in the presence of sugar causes this destruction, which is reversible only when confined to the outer enamel layer. Unless it is removed, the progression of caries is hard to stop once it enters the deeper parts of the tooth.</p>

    <p>If dental caries progresses to reach the pulp, inflammatory pain (pulpitis) occurs which can eventually lead to pulpal necrosis and the tooth becoming non-vital. When this occurs, a tooth may initially be pain free or become tender to touch (apical periodontitis). If left to progress further, a localized accumulation of pus (periapical abscess) may form or an infection of the tooth, gums or alveolar bone supporting the tooth may spread to adjacent vital structures in the head and neck (e.g. cellulitis) or through the bloodstream (e.g. sepsis).</p>

    <p>Accumulation of dental plaque around the gingival margin of teeth (at the gumline) and in periodontal pockets (below the gumline) can stimulate an inflammatory response. In some people this can lead to immune-mediated destruction of the periodontal structures (e.g. gums or alveolar bone) which support the teeth. Progressive destruction of these periodontal tissues may lead to teeth becoming mobile and eventually to tooth loss.</p>

    <p>Some protective mechanisms to reduce plaque accumulation include saliva and the cleansing action of the tongue. Regular removal of plaque through oral hygiene practices, such as toothbrushing and interdental cleaning, is essential to prevent and manage dental caries and periodontal disease.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Epidemiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Despite being largely preventable, oral disease (including dental caries and periodontal disease) is common and an important public health problem <em>(78)</em>.</p>

    <p>Untreated dental caries affect almost half of the world’s population (42% in 2015) making it the most prevalent of the oral conditions reported in the Global Burden of Disease Study <em>(78)</em>.</p>

    <p>The prevalence of untreated caries in permanent teeth was highest in young people aged 15–19 years. Periodontal disease is less common than dental caries, with an overall yearly prevalence of around 7%. As periodontal disease may progress through life, it is highest in older people aged 55–59 years <em>(78)</em>.</p>

    <p>Common risk factors for dental infections include diets high in free sugars and poor oral hygiene leading to dental caries. Poor oral hygiene, smoking or chewing tobacco, stress, malnutrition and being immunocompromised are risk factors for periodontal diseases, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_82" title="82" role="doc-pagebreak"/>including necrotizing periodontal disease (previously known as necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis). Poor oral hygiene and severe malnutrition are also risk factors for noma, a necrotizing disease most commonly seen in children living in low-income countries and with a 90% fatality rate if left untreated.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Most likely pathogens</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">The normal oral microbiota is richly diverse, including both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, together with fungi, especially <em>Candida</em> spp.. Most dental infections are caused by conditions in the oral environment which favour the growth of pathogens. For example, an abundance of free sugars, such as sucrose, favours cariogenic bacteria (e.g. <em>Streptococcus mutans</em>) resulting in tooth decay. Reduced saliva flow makes patients with a dry mouth at increased risk of dental caries as there is less natural protection from the saliva. Furthermore, a recent course of antibiotics is a common cause for oral candidiasis (thrush). While the precise composition of an individual’s oral microbiota will differ between parts of the mouth and will change over time and between individuals, Table 8.1 shows a typical mix of the bacteria that are part of the oral microbiota in health and disease. The oral microbiota and associated disease can be significantly different depending on the precise location. For example, enamel caries is more often associated with <em>Streptococcus mutans</em> whereas <em>Actinomyces</em> spp. predominate in root caries.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Clinical presentation</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Typical signs and symptoms of selected oral conditions are described in the following two sections. Dental pain is often due to inflammation rather than infection and careful diagnosis is required to ensure optimal treatment is provided and antibiotic use minimized.</p>

    <p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_83" title="83" role="doc-pagebreak"/>The severity of signs and symptoms may range from mild diseases (most cases) that can be safely managed in an outpatient setting to severe infections of dental origin (including sepsis) that require hospitalization and intravenous antibiotic treatment. Oral and dental infections commonly involve the lymph nodes and can also spread through the fascial spaces of the head and neck to block the airway, move into the brain through the periorbital area and can present as osteomyelitis. Please refer to the chapters on sepsis, lymphadenitis and osteomyelitis if these sequelae are suspected.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Conditions that may require antibiotic treatment</strong></h2>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Abscess</h3>

    <p class="noindent">An apical abscess (Figure 8.2) is the most common type of dental abscess. It is often, but not always, painful and characterized by persistent localized pain that can radiate to the ear, jaw and neck. Tooth tenderness (stimulated by chewing or food trapping) is common as well as swelling of the soft tissues adjacent to the affected tooth.</p>

    <p>If an apical abscess is left untreated, there is a high risk of spread to vital structures of the head and neck or systemic spread of the infection that can then lead to sepsis. Signs that the infection has spread include cellulitis around the eye or throat (causing difficulties swallowing or breathing, e.g. Ludwig angina), fever (≥ 38.0 °C), malaise, tachycardia (increased heart rate) and lymphadenopathy. This must be treated as a medical emergency.</p>

    <p>A periodontal abscess (Figure 8.2) is less common than an apical abscess. It is usually a localized accumulation of pus in the periodontal tissues (gums and alveolar bone supporting the tooth) which can be readily drained by professional cleaning of the periodontal pocket or by extraction of the tooth without the need for antibiotics.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_84" title="84" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Pericoronitis</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Pericoronitis is inflammation and sometimes infection of the gum around a partially erupted tooth, often a lower wisdom tooth (Figure 8.3). It usually occurs in late adolescence and early adult life and can be treated by professional cleaning, saline (hot salty water) mouthwash and, if necessary, by draining the infection. Antibiotics are not normally required, although if infection is present, it should be carefully monitored as it can spread rapidly causing difficulty opening the mouth, swallowing or breathing. Cellulitis of the neck (e.g. Ludwig angina) is a medical emergency as it can quickly become life-threatening.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Necrotizing periodontal disease</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Necrotizing periodontal disease (Figure 8.4), which was previously known as necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, is characterized by the following: severe pain and inflamed ulcerated gums that bleed easily; necrosis of the interdental papillae; foul breath; and a bad taste in the mouth. It may also be accompanied by systemic symptoms, such as fever ≥ 38.0 °C, malaise and lymphadenopathy.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_85" title="85" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Noma</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Noma is a necrotizing disease that destroys the mouth and face. It begins as necrotizing periodontal disease that progresses rapidly, destroying the soft tissues and bones of the mouth and further progressing to perforate the hard tissues and skin of the face. It mostly affects young children between the ages of 2 and 6 years suffering from severe malnutrition, living in extreme poverty and with weakened immune systems. Its prevalence is highest in sub-Saharan Africa. Noma is fatal for 90% of the children affected. If detected early, its progression can be rapidly halted, through basic oral hygiene rules, diet supplementation with proteins and nutrients and with antibiotics. Early detection helps to prevent suffering, disability and death. Please also refer to the WHO information brochure for early detection and management of noma for more information about this topic <em>(77)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Conditions that do not require antibiotic treatment</strong></h2>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Dental caries progression to pulpal disease</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Dental caries is the localized destruction of dental hard tissue (enamel or dentine) by acid-producing plaque bacteria in the presence of dietary sugar. This process can be reversible in early lesions. Caries can sometimes lead to the formation of cavities (i.e. holes in the tooth) which are often hidden in the space between the teeth. Diagnosis is based on response of the tooth to cold/hot stimulus and radiographic imaging. Cavities and devitalized teeth may appear dark in colour compared to other teeth.</p>

    <p>Caries develops slowly and can be pain free in the initial phase. However, if left untreated, the lesion can extend to the dental pulp causing pulpitis to begin with, then pulpal necrosis and ultimately dental abscess. Severe disease or necrosis of the dental pulp as a consequence of dental caries can be associated with systemic infections.</p>

    <p>Reversible pulpitis is characterized by acute pain or discomfort initially caused by drinking hot or cold beverages. It is possible to treat the problem at this stage with a simple restoration.</p>

    <p>If caries progresses, irreversible pulpitis (Figure 8.5) develops causing constant severe pain which characteristically keeps the patient awake at night. This pain may stop suddenly when progression of the disease leads to necrosis of the dental pulp.</p>

    <p>If left untreated, apical periodontitis (Figure 8.5) often develops, characterized by dull throbbing in the surrounding area (mouth and jaw) and soreness while biting. The pain may be eased by cold and made worse by heat (e.g. hot and cold beverages). Progression of the condition may lead to an apical abscess, and this is the most common cause of dental abscess.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Dry socket / alveolar osteitis</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Dry socket (alveolar osteitis) is a recognized inflammatory complication of tooth extraction. It occurs 2–3 days after extraction and can last for up to 10 days. Severe pain develops a few days after the dental procedure, associated with slow healing of the socket; it may be accompanied by an unpleasant taste. Appropriate pain control is necessary as pain may last for many days. Antibiotics are not appropriate for the prophylaxis or treatment of dry socket unless osteomyelitis is suspected; please refer to the chapter on osteomyelitis if this is suspected.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Periodontal disease</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Periodontal disease (Figure 8.6) is the term used to describe a range of conditions affecting the tissues that surround and support the teeth, including gingivitis and periodontitis. As these are generally immune-mediated diseases, it is usually inappropriate to use antibiotics for their treatment.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_87" title="87" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Gingivitis</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Gingivitis is characterized by redness and swelling of the gums due to the build up of food debris and microbial biofilm. It is usually painless, but bleeding when toothbrushing is common. Halitosis may be present. In its early stages, gingivitis is reversible with good oral hygiene. Severe forms of gingivitis are known but are rare.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Periodontitis</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease characterized by the progressive destruction of the alveolar bone which supports the teeth. It is often a hidden disease as it is generally painless and progresses below the gums. Halitosis may be present. In case of periapical periodontitis, soreness, while biting can occur due to a devitalized (dead) tooth.</p>

    <p>The disease process of periodontitis occurs over time (usually years) and people often only become aware of it when their teeth start to move or fall out; a more aggressive destruction of the bone may sometimes be seen. Oral health professionals use special probes when carrying out periodontal screening to enable early diagnosis and treatment of periodontitis. Addressing risk factors, including effective cleaning of the periodontal tissues (under the gums), smoking cessation and good diabetes control are essential. Antibiotics are only appropriate for the treatment of aggressively destructive conditions; antibiotics are not appropriate for chronic periodontitis.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Laboratory tests</strong></h2>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Patient microbiology tests</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Routine microbiology tests are not required in most cases of dental infection but can be considered in severe cases requiring hospitalization, when culture and sensitivity testing (e.g. blood and/or pus aspirates for culture) can help in the selection of an appropriate antibiotic, for example, if cellulitis (e.g. Ludwig angina) is spreading to vital structures or if sepsis is suspected. Please also refer to the chapter on sepsis, if suspected.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Other tests</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Most dental infections are bacterial, except for oral thrush (a fungal infection usually caused by <em>Candida</em> spp.) and cold sores (a viral infection) which are easily recognizable clinically.</p>

    <p>Acute dental conditions are routinely diagnosed using point-of-care tests and investigations (see point-of-care tests and investigations in the following section).</p>

    <p>Routine laboratory tests are not required in most cases of dental infections but may be considered in severe cases requiring hospitalization.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_88" title="88" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Using microbiology surveillance data</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Routine microbiology surveillance of oral microbiota does not generally take place, so such data are unavailable for clinical guidance.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Point-of-care tests and investigations to assist diagnosis</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Establishing the source of the dental pain/infection is an important element of accurate diagnosis and is essential to make appropriate treatment decisions. Sensitivity of the tooth to a cold stimulus indicates a vital pulp; depending on the intensity and duration of the stimulated pain, this may indicate pulpitis.</p>

    <p>No response to cold may indicate a non-vital/necrotic pulp and tenderness to percussion (tapping the tooth) indicates that the pain originates in the supporting bone and may be due to an abscess. Periodontal probing can identify a periodontal abscess if pus exudes from a pocket greater than 3 mm or necrotizing ulcerative disease if there is extremely tender gingival tissue and grey sloughing.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Imaging</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">If a dental infection is suspected, imaging using dental radiographs (X-rays) should be done wherever possible as part of the diagnosis. Radiographs are important for differentiating between the various causes of dental pain, including how far caries (decay) has progressed and where tenderness to percussion is associated with a radiolucency (i.e. black area on radiographic image) in the alveolar bone suggesting an abscess. Location of the radiolucency relative to the tooth helps differentiate between an apical or periodontal abscess.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Treatment</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Dental bacterial infections are rarely self-limiting and may rapidly become life-threatening if left untreated. Most dental infection and pain are amenable to treatment by removal of the cause and drainage of the infection using a dental procedure, such as extraction of the tooth. Removal of the cause of the infection using a dental procedure is usually the quickest and safest way of resolving the problem, and is essential to avoid the risk of rapidly spreading and potentially life-threatening infection. Antibiotics are normally only required for the treatment of spreading infections.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_89" title="89" role="doc-pagebreak"/>No antibiotic care</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Most dental infections are characterized by some level of dental pain and, while adequate pain control should always be offered, the prescription of medications alone is not usually appropriate.</p>

    <p>Caries, pulpal disease and dental abscesses are best treated with a dental procedure to remove the source of the problem; using painkillers alone is suboptimal as the condition can progress to a life-threatening spreading infection.</p>

    <p>Dry socket (alveolar osteitis) is an extremely painful and common occurrence following dental extraction. It occurs 2–3 days after extraction and can last for up to 10 days. This condition requires optimum pain management but no antibiotics are needed unless osteomyelitis is suspected; please refer to the chapter on osteomyelitis if this is suspected.</p>

    <p>Ibuprofen and paracetamol are first choice painkillers for dental pain (Table 8.2). In the case of severe pain, ibuprofen and paracetamol may work better when taken in combination.</p>

    <p>Caution should be exercised as the incidence of paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose in relation to dental pain is relatively high. Opioid painkillers should be avoided as they offer no benefit for this sort of pain and are associated with the risk of substance misuse.</p>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Oral antiseptics</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Regular use of mouthwashes with an antiseptic product (e.g. chlorhexidine) is not required for the control of dental infections. Such products could be considered in case of acute exacerbations of periodontal disease. Of note, no formulation of oral antiseptics is currently included in the EML and EMLc and rinsing with saline (salty water) is usually adequate as well as being cheaper and more readily available. Caution should be exercised with the use of chlorhexidine mouthwash in patients following extractions or treatment of alveolar osteitis (dry socket following dental extraction) as it has been associated with anaphylaxis.</p>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Antibiotic treatment</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Up to 10% of antibiotic prescribing in the outpatient setting can be by dentists for the treatment of oral and dental infections or prophylaxis of surgical procedures, of which a large proportion have been shown to be unnecessary or inappropriate <em>(79)</em>. Efforts should be made to restrict the use of antibiotics only to situations when their use is strictly necessary <em>(79,80)</em>.</p>

    <p><strong>Antibiotic treatment is required only for few dental conditions</strong>.</p>

    <p>Antibiotics are not appropriate for inflammatory conditions (including periodontitis, irreversible pulpitis and dry socket treatment) because they do not prevent the development of severe complications and cannot replace local surgical or non-surgical treatment.</p>

    <p>Antibiotics should not be used before a dental procedure to: calm an infection; decrease inflammation; cure toothache (pain relief is best achieved by a dental procedure not a dental prescription); or prevent surgical site infections.</p>

    <p>Effective antibiotic treatment (along with a procedure for source control) is essential in patients with severe, spreading dental infections. Severe cases include those with systemic signs of infection, for example, facial swelling, inability to open the mouth, fever ≥ 38.0 °C and tachycardia. Even when necessary, antibiotics should only be used to complement surgical source control, for example, drainage of the abscess or tooth extraction. Antibiotic use could <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_93" title="93" role="doc-pagebreak"/>also be considered in severely immunocompromised patients (including patients with uncontrolled diabetes) because they have a higher risk of complications. When antibiotic treatment is considered necessary, empiric use of amoxicillin or phenoxymethylpenicillin as indicated in Table 8.4 is considered appropriate. Using two antibiotics (e.g. amoxicillin and metronidazole) as adjunctive treatment is not necessary in the vast majority of cases and noma is usually the only indication for dual antibiotic therapy (using two antibiotics such as amoxicillin and metronidazole).</p>

    <p>The AWaRe book does not include alternative antibiotic options in cases of allergy to first-choice antibiotics. For dental infections, only penicillin options are recommended by the AWaRe book, which may be considered problematic by some prescribers. However, even though allergies to antibiotics (particularly to beta-lactams) are frequently self-reported or indicated in health records, in most cases (&gt; 95%), these patients do not have a true immunologically mediated allergy and it is very likely that they can safely tolerate the medicine if re-exposed to it. Please refer to the chapter on allergies to antibiotics for more information about this aspect.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Prevention</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Dental caries does not occur without sugar, thus minimizing dietary free sugars is key to avoiding dental pain and infections caused by dental caries. Further information on dietary sugar can be found in the WHO guidance document on sugar intake for adults and children <em>(73)</em>.</p>

    <p>As the progression of dental caries and periodontal disease may continue slowly from childhood to adulthood, the negative health effects of oral disease are cumulative. Even a small reduction in the risk factors early in life confers significant benefit in later life.</p>

    <p>Stopping tobacco use, whether smoked or smokeless, should also be promoted for the prevention of periodontal disease and oral cancer.</p>

    <p>Preventing the accumulation of dental plaque is important for preventing dental diseases such as dental caries or periodontal disease.</p>

    <p>Where people are unable to perform adequate oral hygiene themselves, regular professional dental cleaning may be necessary to maintain oral health.</p>

    <p>Fluoride plays an important role in improving oral health by strengthening the tooth enamel and making it more resistant to dental caries. Further information on fluoride and oral health can be found on the WHO website <em>(74)</em>. For prevention of dental caries in children, refer to the WHO guidance document <em>(75)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Definition</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Lymphadenitis is the inflammation and enlargement (&gt; 1–2 cm) of one or several lymph nodes. It can be classified as localized (most cases) where only one lymph node region is affected or generalized when multiple lymph node regions are affected. Lymphadenitis can also be classified based on the anatomical site of the lymph node region affected (e.g. cervical or axillary) and on the depth of the lymph node affected, either superficial or deep lymph nodes. Lymphadenitis has several infectious and non-infectious causes, including skin infections, dental infections, cancer or lymphoproliferative disorders. The term lymphadenitis (i.e. enlargement of a lymph node with inflammatory signs) and lymphadenopathy (i.e. disease of a lymph node in which they are abnormal in size and/or consistency) are often used interchangeably, although in lymphadenitis the inflammatory component (redness, warmth and pain) is more pronounced. Infection in the lymph nodes can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites. This chapter focuses on localized acute bacterial lymphadenitis, although most enlarged lymph nodes are caused by viral infections.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_100" title="100" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Lymph nodes are an important part of the immune system which act as filters of lymph fluid. Lymphadenitis from an infectious cause is due to the immune system’s response to localized or generalized inflammation and to the pathogen spreading to one or more lymph node regions.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Epidemiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Lymphadenitis is a common condition worldwide and can occur at all ages; for example, cervical lymphadenitis occurs very frequently in healthy children. Lymphadenitis is usually associated with benign conditions (e.g. most infectious causes); however, it can also be a sign of malignancy (e.g. lymphoma).</p>

    <p>Since lymphadenitis has many different causes, the epidemiology of the disease will reflect the specific etiology. For example, in Africa, tuberculous lymphadenitis (the most frequent cause of extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB)) is still an important cause of persistent lymphadenitis, and chronic lymphadenopathy may be a sign of HIV infection <em>(81)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Most likely pathogens</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Pathogens that can cause lymphadenitis are listed in Table 9.1.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Clinical presentation</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Lymphadenitis is a noticeable enlargement (&gt; 1–2 cm) of a lymph node. Acute onset, unilateral involvement, fluctuance and fluid that drains from the lymph node to the skin suggest a bacterial cause. Tenderness and inflammation are frequently associated with infectious causes. Fever (≥ 38.0 °C) and other signs and symptoms of systemic disease may be present, accompanied by cellulitis. Viral respiratory infections, infectious mononucleosis (caused by Epstein–Barr virus or cytomegalovirus), (acute) HIV infection and mycobacterial infections (mostly TB) always need to be considered when diagnosing the cause of acute lymphadenitis based on clinical history and findings. As the first step, it is important to identify the cause of the enlargement. Location of the enlarged lymph node and accompanying signs and symptoms of infection (e.g. symptoms of a dental infection, skin lesions, pharyngitis and signs and symptoms of an STI) can help establish the diagnosis. History and physical examination (including palpation of lymph nodes) usually help in the diagnosis and guide the investigation and treatment.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_102" title="102" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Laboratory tests</strong></h2>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Patient microbiology tests</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Routine microbiology testing is usually not needed because in most cases with an infectious cause, identifying the etiologic agent will not change the initial management. However, HIV infection and tuberculosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis and adequate testing should be done when these diseases are suspected.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Other tests</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Routine laboratory testing is usually not needed. However, it may be considered in certain cases, for example, persistent lymph node enlargement for more than 4 weeks or the presence of warning signs such as important weight loss.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Using microbiology surveillance data</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Routine surveillance is not helpful to inform empiric guidance.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Biopsy</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">An excisional biopsy of the lymph node could be considered if a malignancy is suspected. An alternative technique that can be used is fine needle aspiration, another type of biopsy technique where a very thin needle is inserted into the mass under examination for sampling of cells/tissue.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Imaging</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Routine imaging is usually not needed to begin with. An ultrasound can be considered to confirm lymph node involvement, to measure the size of the enlargement and to detect the presence of an abscess. However, ultrasound cannot reliably rule out malignancies; in suspected cases an excisional biopsy should be performed.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Antibiotic treatment</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">In certain cases, a watchful waiting approach without antibiotics is indicated when follow-up is feasible and the patient is not severely ill or a malignancy is not suspected. This approach is reasonable because the condition is frequently self-limiting – for example, mild cervical lymphadenitis is usually caused by a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract, especially in children but could also be associated with a dental infection.</p>

    <p>If symptoms are consistent with a bacterial infection (e.g. fever, and painful, tender and inflamed lymph node), empiric treatment against <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em> is indicated. Antibiotic options are given in Table 9.2.</p>

        <li class="box_li"><strong>Conjunctivitis</strong> is mostly self-limiting and of viral origin. Allergies and toxic irritants should be included in the differential diagnosis. Topical antibiotics can be considered if a bacterial infection is suspected. Sexually transmitted infections should be included in the differential diagnosis in sexually active people and in newborns of infected mothers.</li>

        <li class="box_li"><strong>Keratitis</strong> is mostly caused by bacteria and viruses in high-income countries and fungi predominate in low- and middle-income countries. Risk factors include eye trauma and prolonged contact lens use; in the latter case, <em>Acanthamoeba</em>, a parasite, or <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> should be considered as potential causes of the infection. Topical antibiotics are indicated as infectious keratitis is a potentially blinding condition.</li>

        <li class="box_li"><strong>Endophthalmitis</strong> mostly occurs after a penetrating eye trauma (including eye surgery) or dissemination to the eye of a distant infection (e.g. endocarditis). It can be caused by bacteria or fungi. Treatment ideally requires both intravitreal and intravenous antibiotics as it is a potentially blinding condition.</li>

        <li class="box_li"><strong>Periorbital (or preseptal) cellulitis</strong> is usually a mild condition more common in children. It can be treated with oral antibiotics active against Gram-positive pathogens from the skin (e.g. <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>). It is very important to distinguish periorbital (or preseptal) from orbital cellulitis (deeper more severe infection) because the management is different.</li>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Definition</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Pathogens can infect most ocular structures and present with many combinations of signs and symptoms. It is important to determine which anatomical part is infected (Figure 10.1) <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_106" title="106" role="doc-pagebreak"/>because the most probable causative pathogens may differ, with implications for treatment. In addition, eye infections can be acquired in different ways (e.g. exogenous or endogenous, see the pathophysiology section for more information on transmission) and this also has implications for treatment and helps determine the most likely causative pathogens.</p>

    <p>It should be noted that many conditions presented in this chapter could also be of non-infectious origin (e.g. systemic inflammatory diseases affecting other parts of the body or, in the case of conjunctivitis, allergies or toxic irritants), but non-infectious eye conditions are beyond the scope of this chapter.</p>

    <p><strong>This chapter focuses on eye infections of bacterial origin presented in alphabetical order</strong>.</p>

    <p>Infections not addressed in the AWaRe book (because they are rare) include: canaliculitis (infection of the lacrimal canaliculi) and dacryocystis (infection of the lacrimal sac).</p>

    <p class="noindent">Eye infections can result either from external contamination through direct inoculation of the pathogen into the eye/s (exogenous transmission) or from dissemination of the pathogen through the bloodstream from a distant site of infection (endogenous transmission). Exogenous transmission can occur by contact with infected secretions (mostly by rubbing the eye/s with contaminated hands), or as a result of a penetrating eye injury, which includes eye surgery where bacteria from the flora could be introduced. The use of contact lenses and eye contact with water (e.g. during swimming) are also risk factors for exogenous transmission. In addition, certain STIs (e.g. gonococcal and chlamydial infections) can be transmitted from infected mothers to their child during vaginal delivery. Endogenous transmission occurs when pathogens are spread through the bloodstream from other sites of infection (e.g. in the case of endocarditis, UTIs, abdominal abscesses, meningitis and indwelling catheters), mainly in high-risk patients, such as immunocompromised patients and people who inject drugs.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Blepharitis</strong></h2>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Definition</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Blepharitis is an infection of the eyelid margin. It can be anterior (less common than posterior blepharitis and characterized by inflammation at the base of the eyelashes) or posterior (more common, characterized by inflammation of the inner portion of the eyelid at the level of the meibomian glands).</p>

    <p>Hordeolum (stye) is a common acute bacterial infection of one or more eyelid glands.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Epidemiology</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Blepharitis is a chronic condition and most cases are not due to infections but to a dysfunction of oil glands in the eyelids. In posterior blepharitis (the most common form), chronic infections may also play a role. The bacteria that comprise the flora in posterior blepharitis are the same as those found on the skin but are present in greater numbers <em>(82)</em>.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Most likely pathogens</h3>

    <p class="noindent">The most common causative pathogens of blepharitis are shown in Table 10.1.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Patients with blepharitis typically present with inflamed eyelids that are red, swollen and itchy with crusts at the base of the eyelid and on the eyelashes mostly in the morning. Usually both eyes are affected and most cases are chronic.</p>

    <p>Blepharitis is more common in adults than in children, but children can have severe episodes of anterior and/or posterior blepharitis, often characterized by more conjunctival and corneal findings <em>(83,84)</em>.</p>

    <p>Blepharitis related to <em>Demodex</em> infestation characteristically presents with cylindrical dandruff or “sleeves” on the eyelashes <em>(85)</em>. Patients with hordeolum usually present with a tender swelling of the eyelid/s with a lash at its apex.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Epidemiology</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Conjunctivitis is the most frequent eye infection and most cases are of viral origin in both children and adults. Bacterial cases, although less common, can occur, especially in children.

    <p class="noindent">Patients with conjunctivitis (including cases of viral origin) usually present with a red, watery and itchy eye. They often describe a feeling of “sand in the eye” with no pain (if there is pain, this usually indicates corneal involvement) and they have normal vision. In cases of bacterial infection, a thick purulent discharge from the eye is usually present. Patients may refer to all discharge as pus; however, in bacterial conjunctivitis, the complaint of discharge predominates, while in viral and allergic conjunctivitis, patients report a burning and gritty feeling or itching and the eye usually presents with a watery discharge. In most cases, conjunctivitis is a mild self-limiting condition.</p>

    <p>A severe form of conjunctivitis is hyperacute bacterial conjunctivitis which is mostly caused by <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em>. It is characterized by severe purulent discharge and decreased vision. Usually, eyelid swelling, pain on palpation and preauricular adenopathy are present <em>(86)</em>.</p>

    <p>In neonates, conjunctivitis can be caused by a range of pathogens. In general, gonococcal or staphylococcal infection is more likely to present early with symptoms in the first 5 days of life, with chlamydial infection generally presenting later (&gt; 5 days after birth).</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Antibiotic treatment</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Most cases of infectious conjunctivitis are self-limiting, of viral origin and resolve without treatment in 7–10 days. In patients with typical presentation of bacterial conjunctivitis (i.e. red eye with purulent discharge and normal vision), antibiotic treatment could be considered to shorten the duration of symptoms <em>(88)</em> based on the patient’s preferences. In these cases, antibiotic treatment is usually topical (eye drops or eye ointment) and prescribed empirically (Table 10.3) based on local availability. Systemic antibiotic treatment is only required in cases of systemic infections, for example, conjunctivitis in the context of an STI (Table 10.3). Steroid eye drops (alone or in combination with antibiotic drops) are not usually needed for the treatment of conjunctivitis; in fact, steroids might even make the condition worse if it is caused by herpes virus infection or the cornea is affected.</p>

    <p>Urgent referral of the patient to an ophthalmologist, if available, should be considered when hyperacute bacterial conjunctivitis (mostly caused by <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em>) is suspected because of the risk of rapid progression to corneal perforation.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Epidemiology</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Endophthalmitis mostly has an exogenous cause and occurs as a result of penetrating eye trauma, after eye surgery or as a complication of keratitis. Endogenous cases of endophthalmitis are rare but can occur because of bacteraemia or fungaemia from distant sites of infection, most often endocarditis and liver abscess depending on the setting <em>(90,91)</em>. Injection of drugs is a common risk factor in patients with endogenous infections.

    <p class="noindent">Endophthalmitis is usually an acute condition and patients present with a painful red eye, blurred vision and trouble looking at bright light (i.e. photophobia). Most cases are exogenous and typically occur after eye surgery (usually within days or a few weeks) or trauma. In rare cases, endophthalmitis can result from the haematogenous spread of pathogens from distant sites of infection, such as endocarditis and liver abscess. In these cases, signs and symptoms of bacteraemia can be present although in most cases ocular symptoms occur first.</p>

    <p class="noindent">This condition should be treated by an ophthalmologist where available. Urgent referral of the patient to an ophthalmologist, if available, should be considered when endophthalmitis is suspected because this condition could potentially threaten the patient’s sight.</p>

    <p>With bacterial endophthalmitis, the cornerstone of treatment is intravitreal injection of antibiotics. There are two common approaches:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>“tap and inject”: first a sample of vitreous humour is collected for culture (through vitreous aspiration) and then antibiotics are injected into the vitreous</li>

      <li>vitrectomy is performed – that is, eye surgery to remove some or all the inflamed vitreous from the eye as a form of source control – and during the procedure, the antibiotic is injected into the vitreous.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_126" title="126" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Systemic antibiotics (in combination with intravitreal antibiotics) should also be considered given the severity of this condition, especially when referral to an ophthalmologist is not readily available (Table 10.6). In cases of endogenous infections, systemic antibiotics should always be given. However, evidence of their added benefit (e.g. on visual acuity) compared to intravitreal treatment alone is still controversial. The ability to rapidly reach adequate concentrations of antibiotics in the eye varies by antibiotic <em>(95)</em>.</p>

    <p>There is limited evidence of the benefit of additive treatment with intravitreal steroid therapy compared to antibiotics alone <em>(96)</em>.</p>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Definition</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Keratitis is an infection of the cornea, the transparent covering of the eye.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Epidemiology</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Keratitis is common and the estimated number of cases is more than 2 million per year <em>(97)</em>. The highest (epidemic) burden is in South, South-East and East Asia <em>(97)</em>, especially in rural settings among male workers in high-risk professions as eye trauma is the predominant risk factor <em>(98)</em>. In high-income countries, the number of cases of keratitis has increased over time, probably because of the increased use of contact lenses; their use is currently the most common risk factor in this setting. The disease is rare in children, but it is also harder to diagnose, mostly because it is more difficult to obtain a clinical history and to collect a sample for microbiology tests.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Most likely pathogens</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Patients with keratitis generally present with a painful eye, decreased vision, more tears and corneal oedema. They often describe a feeling of “having something in the eye” and have difficulty keeping the affected eye open. A discharge from the eye may be seen depending on the causative pathogen. Most infectious cases are of bacterial origin, although in low-and middle-income countries, fungal infections are common, for example, as a result of trauma from plants or sand or mud in rural settings <em>(97)</em>. Reactivation of herpes simplex virus could also cause keratitis, especially in patients with HIV infection or in patients with other forms of immunosuppression. Ophthalmologic examination with a slit lamp is usually needed to visualize the cornea and confirm the diagnosis: focal white infiltrates in the corneal stroma with an epithelial defect and underlying tissue loss are the critical sign of keratitis.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Patients with orbital cellulitis typically have unilateral local signs of inflammation around the affected eye. The eyelids are usually swollen, red, warm and tender. Sometimes fever is present (≥ 38.0 °C). These findings are also present in cases of periorbital (or preseptal) cellulitis (see next section); however, in addition to these symptoms, patients with orbital cellulitis present with restricted extraocular motility with pain on attempted eye movement, conjunctival chemosis (i.e. swelling) and hyperaemia (i.e. redness) as critical signs. Usually this condition is accompanied by protrusion of the eye (i.e. proptosis) and loss of vision may be present <em>(101)</em>. Signs of optic neuropathy (e.g. afferent pupillary defect and dyschromatopsia) may be present in severe cases. In neglected cases, orbital cellulitis may lead to cavernous sinus thrombosis, brain abscess or even death.</p>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Clinical presentation</h3>

    <p class="noindent">It is very important to distinguish periorbital (or preseptal) from orbital cellulitis. Patients with periorbital (or preseptal) cellulitis typically present with unilateral local signs of inflammation around the affected eye but do not have restricted or painful eye movements, as occurs in case of orbital cellulitis. The eyelid/s is generally swollen, red, warm and tender and sometimes fever is present (≥ 38.0 °C). In severe cases, conjunctival chemosis (i.e. swelling) may also occur. Vision is normal, while in case of orbital cellulitis loss of vision may be present <em>(101)</em>. In periorbital (or preseptal) cellulitis, serious complications are rare <em>(107)</em>.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Antibiotic treatment</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Systemic antibiotic treatment is indicated and is usually given empirically based on the most likely causative pathogens because cultures are difficult to obtain and blood cultures when performed are usually negative (Table 10.13). Empiric treatment of MRSA may be considered in certain cases based on individual risk factors (e.g. known MRSA colonization) and on the local prevalence of community-acquired MRSA. In these cases, the literature suggests using clindamycin or sulfamethoxazole+trimethoprim; however, no formal recommendation can be made in the AWaRe book as these options are not currently listed in the EML and EMLc for this indication.</p>

    <p>Most cases of periorbital (or preseptal) cellulitis can be managed with oral antibiotic treatment; however, in severely ill patients or very young children, intravenous treatment may be considered <em>(105)</em>.</p>

    <p>Adults and children older than 1 year with mild periorbital (or preseptal) cellulitis and no signs of systemic toxicity can generally be treated as outpatients with oral antibiotics, provided close follow-up can be ensured.</p>

    <p>Children younger than 1 year, patients who cannot cooperate fully for an examination, who are severely ill or in case of no noticeable improvement or worsening after 24 to 48 hours of oral antibiotics should generally be admitted to the hospital and managed according to the recommendations for orbital cellulitis.</p>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Definition</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Uveitis is an infection of the uvea, which is composed of:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>iris – the coloured ring-shaped part of the eye behind the cornea</li>

      <li>ciliary body – the part that extends around the iris, has a muscular component and produces the aqueous humour that keeps the eye in a pressurized state</li>

      <li>choroid – a vascular layer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Epidemiology</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Infectious uveitis can be caused by a large number of pathogens and most cases are associated with systemic infections, but it may also occur as an isolated condition. Therefore, the epidemiology depends on the underlying infection. In general, certain factors can increase the risk of specific infections, for example, cytomegalovirus is mostly associated with uveitis in immunocompromised patients.</p>

    <p class="noindent">The symptoms of uveitis are non-specific and depend on the portion of the uveal tract that is involved. Findings also differ depending upon the location of the involvement, and visual loss may occur with anterior, intermediate or posterior involvement. Anterior uveitis is about four times more common than posterior uveitis <em>(108)</em>. Patients with uveitis usually have a painful red eye and decreased vision. Infectious forms of uveitis are mostly of viral origin (e.g. herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus) or they may occur as a reactivation of toxoplasmosis.</p>

    <p>When uveitis is suspected, patients should be seen by an ophthalmologist, if available, because the list of potential conditions associated with uveitis is large and, in some cases, uveitis is a potentially sight-threatening condition.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Definition</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Trachoma is an eye disease caused by specific serovars (A through C) of the bacterium <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> (other serovars cause urogenital diseases, please see the chapter on sexually transmitted infections – Chlamydia urogenital infections). Trichiasis is the advanced clinical consequence of trachoma characterized by the eyelashes turning inwards which leads over time to permanent corneal damage. Trichiasis is a sight-threatening condition that requires surgical treatment.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_143" title="143" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Pathogen</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Trachoma is caused by <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em>, a Gram-negative obligate intracellular bacterium. There are several strains of <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em>, some associated with trachoma and some associated with sexually transmitted urogenital diseases. Strains associated with trachoma are serovars A, B, Ba and C.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent"><em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> infection spreads via the hands through direct contact with contaminated people or objects. Flies can also spread the infection by transporting contaminated eye and/or nose secretions from infected to non-infected people. Chronic inflammation of the conjunctiva caused by repeated infections over the years can cause inversion of the eyelashes that can lead to permanent corneal damage through formation of scars on the cornea (the transparent front part of the eye). This can eventually lead to vision impairment and blindness <em>(113)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Epidemiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Trachoma is the leading cause of infectious blindness in the world and is responsible for about 1% of cases of blindness. According to the most recent WHO estimates, more than 137 million people worldwide live with trachoma <em>(109)</em>. The infection is a public health problem in over 40 countries, most of which are in Africa <em>(109)</em>.</p>

    <p>Risk factors of trachoma include living in overcrowded conditions and poor sanitation, and most transmission occurs within families. Active disease (i.e. conjunctivitis) is more common in young children living in endemic areas. Children younger than 10 years and those with intense inflammatory trachoma probably represent the main source of ocular <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> infection in endemic communities <em>(114)</em>. Corneal scars are mostly seen in adults because repeated infections over time need to occur before permanent corneal damage is established. Individuals with corneal scars are at increased risk of blindness.</p>

    <p>In 1993, WHO adopted the SAFE strategy for the elimination of trachoma:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>S</strong>urgery to treat advanced diseases,</li>

      <li><strong>A</strong>ntibiotics to clear infection,</li>

      <li><strong>F</strong>acial cleanliness and</li>

      <li><strong>E</strong>nvironmental improvement to reduce transmission.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In 1996, WHO established the alliance for the global elimination of trachoma, whose goal was to eliminate trachoma as a public health problem by 2020 (Box 11.1). In addition, in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_144" title="144" role="doc-pagebreak"/>1998, the World Health Assembly adopted a resolution on trachoma to urge WHO Member States to implement measures to target the elimination of trachoma <em>(110)</em>. As of July 2020, 13 out of 30 countries that are implementing the SAFE strategy have achieved the WHO elimination targets. As part of the elimination strategy, data reported to WHO for 2019 indicate that about 92 000 people had corrective surgery for trichiasis and 95 million people received antibiotic treatment, that is, 57% of people needing antibiotics for trachoma received them <em>(109)</em>.</p>

    <div class="box_azul">
      <p class="box_tit"><strong><a id="Box11.1"/>Box 11.1 – World Health Organization definitions related to trachoma</strong></p>

        <li class="box_li">the prevalence of trachomatous trichiasis in people aged ≥ 15 years is at least 1%.</li>
      </ul>

      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Clinical presentation</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Trachoma diagnosis is based on clinical signs. Trachoma presents as an active disease (i.e. conjunctivitis) with symptoms such as redness of the eye, eye discomfort, mucopurulent discharge and light sensitivity.</p>

    <p>The other presentation is the advanced disease where there is conjunctival scarring, signs of chronic conjunctival inflammation and eyelashes turned inwards.</p>

    <p>The WHO trachoma grading system is used in field assessments to evaluate the extent of disease during examination <em>(111)</em>.</p>

    <p>The grading system includes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Trachomatous inflammation, follicular – five or more follicles of &gt; 0.5 mm on a specific area of the upper tarsal conjunctiva</li>

      <li>Trachomatous inflammation, intense – papillary hypertrophy and inflammatory thickening of the upper tarsal conjunctiva obscuring more than half the deep tarsal vessels</li>

      <li><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_145" title="145" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Trachomatous conjunctival scarring – grossly visible scars on the tarsal conjunctiva</li>

      <li>Trachomatous trichiasis – at least one ingrown eyelash touching the globe of the eye or evidence of epilation (eyelash removal)</li>

      <li>Corneal opacity – corneal opacity blurring part of the pupil margin.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Patient microbiology tests</h3>

    <p class="noindent">The diagnosis of trachoma is mostly clinical and microbiology tests are not routinely done.

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_153" title="153" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">CAP occurs when microbial pathogens (usually inhaled in the upper airways) reach the lower respiratory tract and proliferate in the alveoli. Less frequently, these pathogens can also reach the alveoli via the blood or by direct spread, for example, from an infection of the pleural or intra-abdominal space. Once in the alveoli, host immune defences are activated to eliminate the pathogens. Only when these defences fail, pneumonia manifests itself because of the tissue damage and inflammatory response triggered by the proliferation of microorganisms in the affected lung(s).</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Epidemiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">CAP is common worldwide and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, with an especially high burden in low-income countries <em>(120)</em>. According to the Global Burden of Disease study, in 2017 there were an estimated 471 million new cases of lower respiratory tract infections globally among all ages and sexes combined. This number included CAP cases but also a majority of cases of viral bronchitis – therefore caution is needed in interpreting this number <em>(44)</em>. The incidence of CAP varies with age and a country’s income level. The most common causative pathogens worldwide are <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> and viruses (see the following section); viral–bacterial coinfections may occur.</p>

    <p>In low-income countries, lower respiratory tract infections (including CAP) were the leading cause of death in 2016, with a crude yearly attributable mortality of about 75 per 100 000 population <em>(121)</em>. In general, the incidence of CAP is highest in children younger than 5 years in these countries. In 2015, an estimated 0.9 million children younger than 5 years died of pneumonia and of these, about 0.5 million occurred in sub-Saharan Africa <em>(122)</em>. Undernutrition, HIV infection, exposure to smoke and air pollution are common risk factors for severe CAP in children younger than 5 years. As a result of better access to medical care, better nutrition and greater vaccination coverage, global mortality rates in children have declined by more than 30% since 2000. In high-income countries, CAP mainly affects adults 65 years and older and, in general, the incidence of CAP and risk of death increase with age <em>(123)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Most likely pathogens</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">In <strong>neonates and young infants aged up to 2 months</strong>, pneumonia is mainly caused by <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, group B <em>Streptococcus</em>, Enterobacterales or <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>.</p>

    <p>In <strong>children aged 2 months to 5 years</strong>, pneumonia is more likely to be of viral origin, for example, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza and parainfluenza virus. The most important bacterial pathogen in children younger than 5 years is <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_154" title="154" role="doc-pagebreak"/>In <strong>older children</strong><em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> is still common but atypical bacteria such as <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em> and <em>Chlamydia pneumoniae</em> may be the cause. So-called atypical bacteria have intrinsic resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics and cannot by visualized by Gram staining. <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, <em>Moraxella catarrhalis</em> and <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> also cause CAP in some children (Table 12.1).</p>

    <p>In <strong>adults</strong>, viruses are common causes of CAP, either by directly causing pneumonia or by favouring superinfection with bacteria. Among bacteria, the most common causative agents are <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, followed by atypical bacteria (see definition in the paragraph above) such as <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em>, <em>Chlamydia pneumoniae</em> and <em>Legionella pneumophila</em>. <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, <em>Moraxella catarrhalis</em> and <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> are also quite common (Table 12.1).</p>

    <p>However, determining the cause of bacterial pneumonia is difficult in all age groups and no causative pathogen is identified in most cases, even if extensive microbiological tests are performed, which is usually not the case for mild cases. Furthermore, there may be important geographic differences in the cause of pneumonia; for example, <em>Burkholderia pseudomallei</em> is a cause of CAP in South-East Asia, while <em>Coxiella burnetii</em> is more common in regions where exposure to livestock is common.</p>

    <p class="noindent">AMR is a potential problem with all pathogens associated with CAP. However, clinically relevant high-level beta-lactam resistance in <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> is still rare globally. Resistance to macrolides in <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> and <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em> is highly prevalent in some settings <em>(124,125)</em>.</p>

    <div class="box_amarelo">
      <p class="box_tit"><img src="../Images/notes_icon.jpg" alt="Imagem"/> <strong>Note</strong></p>

      <p class="box_p">CAP caused by low-level and intermediate-level pneumococcal penicillin resistance can be successfully treated with higher oral doses of the Access antibiotics amoxicillin or penicillin in children and adults.</p>
    </div>

    <p>There is no evidence of improved clinical outcomes in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia in the primary health care setting treated with oral cephalosporins, amoxicillin+clavulanic acid or macrolides compared to amoxicillin and penicillin, and these antibiotics are associated with higher rates of toxicity.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Clinical presentation</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Nearly all respiratory diseases can mimic the symptoms of CAP. Based on clinical features alone it is often impossible to distinguish bacterial from viral pneumonia or from other non-infectious causes. Local epidemiology and laboratory tests may help.</p>

    <p>Well established clinical features of CAP include a combination of new onset (less than 2 weeks) of symptoms, worsening cough with or without sputum production, dyspnoea (difficulty in breathing), tachypnoea (abnormal respiratory rates to diagnose rapid breathing vary with age), reduced oxygen saturation, crepitations on lung auscultation, or chest pain or discomfort without an alternative explanation. Fever ≥ 38.0 °C for 3–4 days is usually present but may be absent, especially in elderly people. Extrapulmonary features such as confusion or disorientation may be the main symptoms in elderly people, immunocompromised patients and malnourished children. The severity of signs and symptoms may range from a mild disease that can be safely managed in an outpatient setting with oral antibiotic treatment to severe pneumonia with respiratory distress, sepsis requiring intensive care and intravenous antibiotic treatment, and a high associated mortality.</p>

    <p>In children, WHO defines fast breathing pneumonia as a child with a high respiratory rate for their age (&gt; 50 breaths/minute in children 2–11 months of age; &gt; 40 breaths/minute in children aged 1–5 years). They may or may not have chest indrawing.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_156" title="156" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Laboratory tests</strong></h2>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Patient microbiology tests</h3>

    <p class="noindent">In mild cases that can be managed in the outpatient setting, microbiology tests are usually not needed. Tests for COVID-19 and influenza can be considered if clinically indicated and available. The TB lipoarabinomannan rapid antigen urinary test should be considered in patients living with HIV who are severely immunocompromised and who present with signs and symptoms of TB.</p>

    <p>For more information on this topic, the interested reader can refer to the 2019 WHO policy update: <em>Lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan assay (LF-LAM) for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis in people living with HIV: policy update 2019 (126)</em>.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Other tests</h3>

    <p class="noindent">In mild cases, laboratory tests are usually not needed. If available, point-of-care testing for C-reactive protein could be considered in adult patients if there is diagnostic uncertainty.</p>

    <p>In general, C-reactive protein has good negative predictive value, and a negative test can be used to help rule out bacterial pneumonia, unless the pre-test probability is high or the clinical presentation is severe.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Using microbiology surveillance data</h3>

    <p class="noindent">The great majority of episodes of CAP in the primary care setting are caused by pneumococcal isolates that clinically respond to oral penicillins. Therefore, routine clinical microbiology surveillance of CAP does not help to inform local empiric guidance.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Imaging</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">When mild CAP is suspected clinically, a chest X-ray is usually not necessary.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Scores to determine disease severity and guide treatment decisions</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">WHO recommends that children who meet the criteria of severe pneumonia should be admitted to hospital (see the hospital facility section for the management of severe cases).</p>

    <p>As a general rule for children, hospitalization is indicated in cases of severe illness (e.g. cough and severe respiratory distress, marked tachypnoea and tachycardia) and/or if the child is unable to take oral therapy.</p>

    <p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_157" title="157" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>In children</strong>, severe pneumonia is characterized by signs of pneumonia (fast breathing with or without chest indrawing) plus a general danger sign, such as inability to breastfeed or drink, convulsions, lethargy or a reduced level of consciousness <em>(118)</em>.</p>

    <p><strong>In adults</strong>, several scores exist that measure severity and help predict 30-day mortality. These scores, in addition to clinical judgement, can be used to determine the need for hospitalization in immunocompetent adults diagnosed with CAP. In view of its simplicity, one of the more frequently used scores is the CURB-65 <em>(127)</em>, or its modification, CRB-65, which does not require laboratory values for its calculation (Table 12.2). However, it should be noted that these scores have not been extensively validated in low-income settings and for this reason there is no clear consensus about their use in these settings <em>(128)</em>. As well as severity scores, other factors, such as severe comorbid illnesses (e.g. HIV infection) or inability to maintain oral therapy, should always be taken into account in determining the need for hospital admission.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Ruling out tuberculosis</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">TB is a cause of subacute lower respiratory tract infection and should be considered in settings endemic for TB, especially in high-risk patients (e.g. children or adults with HIV), with a slow onset of symptoms and persistent cough, or those who do not respond to the initial antibiotic treatment. In such cases, specific investigations for TB should be done. A rapid molecular test (GeneXpert® MTB/RIF assay) performed on a single sputum specimen is currently the preferred first-line diagnostic test for pulmonary TB and to detect rifampicin resistance in both children and adults. When this rapid test is not available, microscopy examination of sputum smears could be considered for the detection of acid-fast bacilli <em>(129)</em>. For TB management and treatment, refer to the <em>WHO consolidated guidelines on tuberculosis (119)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Symptomatic care</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Patients and/or their caregivers in the primary health care setting should be informed about the natural course of CAP, including the possibility of a viral etiology that would not benefit from antibiotic treatment and that cough and other symptoms often take 2–3 weeks to fully recover from. Patients should also receive clear advice on seeking medical care with any worsening of symptoms and recommended symptomatic treatment (e.g. antipyretics) (Table 12.3).</p>

Amoxicillin or phenoxymethylpenicillin (sometimes also called penicillin V) are the recommended first choice options for mild-to-moderate CAP.</p>

    <p>Empiric treatment should be guided by the age of the patient, severity of symptoms, presence of comorbidities and previous antibiotic treatment. Clinical improvement should be evident within 48–72 hours of starting antibiotic therapy. If there is no response to treatment, a complication (such as empyema) should be considered. Duration of treatment should be guided by measures of clinical improvement (e.g. resolution of fever); usually 5 days of treatment are adequate for adults and 3–5 days for children.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Prevention</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Vaccination can prevent many cases of CAP. Available vaccines are active against pneumococcal infection, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b disease and influenza, and several vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are available. Vaccines are never 100% effective and because they are serogroup-specific, they do not protect against all strains of bacteria or viruses. Duration of protection is also variable. As a result, even vaccinated people can develop CAP. <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b conjugate vaccines and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines should be included in all routine infant immunization programmes as they have been very successful in reducing invasive disease and in many countries, in reducing rates of pneumococcal resistance. Countries should consider the inclusion of yearly seasonal influenza vaccination for high-risk populations (pregnant women, elderly people, patients with chronic medical conditions and health care workers) in their vaccination plan.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_165" title="165" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Exacerbations of COPD are a worsening of the existing underlying chronic inflammation of the respiratory tract and are caused in most cases by irritants (e.g. pollution, smoking, dusts and chemicals) or respiratory tract infections. Exacerbations can accelerate a decline in lung function (i.e. disease progression). The frequency of exacerbations of COPD is variable among individuals with COPD but they occur more often in cases of severe COPD <em>(135)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Epidemiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">According to the Global Burden of Diseases study, in 2017, there were 299 million prevalent cases of COPD and 3.19 million deaths caused by COPD <em>(44,136)</em>. In 2014, more than 90% of deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries <em>(137)</em>.</p>

    <p>COPD includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis. The most prevalent risk factor is exposure to tobacco smoke and indoor household air pollution <em>(138)</em>. The incidence of exacerbations increases with age, especially in smokers, and mortality is higher in severe episodes.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Most likely pathogens</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Exacerbations of COPD are triggered by viral infections in most cases when a pathogen is identified (Table 13.1). However, in most cases of exacerbation of COPD, no pathogen is identified <em>(139,140)</em>.</p>

    <p class="noindent">An exacerbation of COPD should be suspected in cases of recent and sustained worsening of dyspnoea and cough with increased sputum production compared with the baseline of patients with COPD, that is, chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Symptoms can overlap with those of pneumonia; however, tachycardia, tachypnoea at rest and crepitations that persist (i.e. that do not clear) after coughing suggest pneumonia.</p>

    <p>The decision to hospitalize a person with an exacerbation of COPD should be guided by the severity of symptoms, assessment of comorbidities and availability of home support.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Laboratory tests</strong></h2>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Patient microbiology tests</h3>

    <p class="noindent">When an exacerbation of COPD is suspected clinically, sputum Gram stain and culture are not recommended routinely. In people with COPD, the respiratory tract may for example be colonized with <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, <em>Moraxella catarrhalis</em> and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, and a positive culture may indicate colonization rather than acute infection.</p>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Other tests</h3>

    <p class="noindent">When exacerbations of COPD are suspected clinically, certain laboratory tests could be considered, in particular tests that can help identify patients with bacterial infections and that can help assess the severity of the exacerbation. The rationale is that these patients would benefit the most from antibiotic treatment. For example, C-reactive protein <em>(141,142)</em>, procalcitonin, and complete blood count and blood gas analysis may be useful. However, there is no clear consensus across guidelines about which tests should be performed routinely in the hospital setting and such tests may not be available in many settings.</p>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Using microbiology surveillance data</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Routine surveillance of clinical isolates from patients presenting with exacerbations of COPD is not helpful to inform local or national prescribing guidance.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Imaging</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">A chest X-ray could be considered in patients requiring hospitalization in order to exclude other diagnoses (e.g. pneumonia, pulmonary oedema) or in outpatients if pneumonia is suspected and chest radiography is available.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_167" title="167" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>No antibiotic care</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">The core treatment of an exacerbation episode consists of supplementary oxygen and short-acting inhaled beta-2-agonists (with or without anticholinergics). Most guidelines currently recommend using systemic steroids because they help improve lung function and shorten time to recovery.</p>

    <p>A detailed discussion of non-antibiotic management of COPD is beyond the scope of this chapter. Additional information can be found on the WHO website <em>(132)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Antibiotic treatment</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Most exacerbations of COPD are not triggered by bacterial infections, therefore only certain cases will benefit from antibiotic treatment.</p>

    <div class="box_amarelo">
      <p class="box_tit"><img src="../Images/notes_icon.jpg" alt="Imagem"/> <strong>Note</strong></p>

      <p class="box_p">Antibiotic treatment is not required in the great majority of cases of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Antibiotics are not needed for most cases. Their use could be considered in severe exacerbations of COPD. Most guidelines suggest antibiotic treatment for patients hospitalized because of an acute exacerbation of COPD, especially if an increased volume and purulence of sputum is present, because these cases are more likely to be caused by a bacterial infection. Severe exacerbations benefit more from antibiotic treatment (see Table 13.2 for antibiotic options). Current evidence suggests that the benefit in terms of reduced short-term mortality and reduced treatment failure is limited to hospitalized patients in intensive care units <em>(143)</em>. Previous colonization of the respiratory tract (e.g. with <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>) needs to be taken into account when choosing empiric treatment. Patients with frequent episodes of COPD exacerbations may have received multiple courses of antibiotic treatment during the year and have a higher risk of infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Acute diarrhoeal disease (also known as gastroenteritis) is a disease characterized by acute onset (usually defined as a duration of &lt; 14 days) of diarrhoea. Diarrhoea is defined as the passage of unusually loose or watery stools occurring at least three times a day (or more frequently than is normal for the individual). Consistency (how liquid/runny) rather than frequency (how often) is the most important factor to consider and frequent passing of formed stool is not diarrhoea. In breastfed babies, frequent loose pale-coloured stools are not considered diarrhoea <em>(145)</em>. Most cases of acute diarrhoea have an infectious origin, but non-infectious causes are also possible, for example: adverse effects of medicines, including antibiotics and cytotoxic chemotherapy; endocrine diseases; inflammatory bowel diseases; and irritable bowel syndrome. Acute diarrhoea can be further subclassified as <strong>watery</strong> diarrhoea or <strong>bloody</strong> diarrhoea (i.e. presence of visible blood in the stool).</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_175" title="175" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Acute diarrhoeal diseases can be acquired through ingestion of food or water contaminated with viral or bacterial pathogens (rarely protozoal or fungal pathogens) or through direct contact with someone carrying the pathogen. Establishment of an enteric infection depends on the capacity of the pathogen to invade the mucosa and overcome the host defences. It is dependent on several factors, including the inoculum, the virulence of the organism and the status of host defences. Production of enterotoxins (i.e. bacterial proteins that act on the host’s intestinal cells) is a frequently encountered mechanism of disease.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Epidemiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">In 2017, 6.2 billion episodes of diarrhoeal disease were estimated to have occurred worldwide, including 500 000 incident cases of intestinal/non-invasive/diarrhoeal non-typhoidal <em>Salmonella</em> disease <em>(44)</em>.</p>

    <p>Children younger than 5 years are often affected. About 1.7 billion cases of acute diarrhoeal disease occur each year in this age group where it is an important cause of death (about 450 000 deaths in 2016). Acute malnutrition, living in or travelling to areas with limited access to safe drinking-water and adequate sanitation are the leading risk factors for acute diarrhoeal diseases <em>(146,151)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Most likely pathogens</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Most cases of community-acquired acute watery diarrhoeal disease have a viral origin. However, bacteria and parasites can also be causes <em>(152)</em>. For returning travellers, it is important to consider travel-associated diarrhoea. Table 14.1 and Table 14.2 give the pathogens most frequently associated with acute diarrhoeal disease (in children and adults respectively), and Table 14.3 the pathogens associated with chronic or persistent diarrhoea.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Clinical presentation</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">In acute diarrhoea, the main symptom is new onset (&lt; 14 days) of three or more unformed stools a day, with or without fever. Nausea, vomiting, bloating, abdominal pain and cramping may also be present. In most cases, the disease is self-limiting. Since some causative pathogens can be endemic in certain settings and absent in others, it is always important to consider where the patient became infected (including history of recent travel) and recent consumption of potentially unsafe food (e.g. raw meat or unpasteurized milk products). Recent antibiotic use (past 3 months), cytotoxic chemotherapy or the presence of immunosuppression (e.g. HIV infection) also need to be investigated.</p>

    <p>Five common clinical presentations can help identify cases that require specific treatment and management <em>(145)</em>.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Patients with <strong>watery diarrhoea</strong>. In these patients, the most likely cause is viral, mostly rotavirus and norovirus. A mild fever and vomiting may also occur. The main risk is severe dehydration and management is symptomatic (e.g. fluid replacement).</li>

      <li>Patients with <strong>bloody diarrhoea</strong> (dysentery or invasive diarrhoea with damage to the intestinal mucosa). In these patients, the most likely cause are bacteria, mostly <em>Shigella</em> spp., <em>Campylobacter</em> spp., intestinal/non-invasive/diarrheal non-typhoidal <em>Salmonella</em> or enterotoxigenic <em>Escherichia coli</em>. These cases may benefit from antibiotic treatment. In addition to dehydration, these infections can be complicated by sepsis and malnutrition. <em>Entamoeba histolytica</em> can rarely also cause bloody diarrhoea weeks or months after the infection; often these infections are responsible for chronic rather than acute bloody diarrhoea. Other protozoal parasites and very rarely <em>Schistosoma</em> can also cause bloody diarrhoea; only <em>Schistosoma mansoni</em> and <em>Schistosoma japonicum</em>, the intestinal species.</li>

      <li><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_178" title="178" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Patients with <strong>persistent diarrhoea</strong>(symptoms lasting &gt; 14 days). In these patients, a parasite is often implicated (e.g. <em>Giardia intestinalis</em>, <em>Entamoeba histolytica</em>) and the main risks are malnutrition and dehydration.</li>

      <li><strong>Diarrhoea with severe malnutrition</strong>. In these patients, malnutrition is both a cause and consequence of diarrhoea.</li>

      <li><strong>Diarrhoea with recent antibiotic exposure</strong> (<em>Clostridioides difficile</em>). This condition is mostly hospital-acquired; please refer to the chapter on <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> infection if this is suspected.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Patients may present with varying degrees of dehydration and this should be promptly assessed, especially in children and elderly people. In children, the degree of dehydration can be rated on a scale of three as indicated in Table 14.4 <em>(146)</em>.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Routine laboratory tests are usually not needed. However, for severe cases, electrolytes should be checked if available.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Using microbiology surveillance data</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Targeted clinical microbiological surveys of cases of acute bloody diarrhoea in the primary care setting in children and adults, specifically focusing on quinolone and macrolide resistance rates in <em>Shigella</em> and intestinal/non-invasive/diarrhoeal non-typhoidal <em>Salmonella</em>, may be helpful to inform local empiric antibiotic guidance.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_180" title="180" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Imaging</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Routine imaging is not needed for acute diarrhoeal disease.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>No antibiotic care</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Rehydration is the main treatment for acute diarrhoeal disease (oral or intravenous). In children, treating any diarrhoea with oral rehydration therapy using a low-osmolarity oral rehydration solution to prevent dehydration is recommended <em>(145)</em>. In addition, zinc tablets (10–20 mg/day) for 10–14 days are usually recommended to shorten the duration and severity of symptoms <em>(31,145)</em>.</p>

    <p>In adults, an oral rehydration solution is not usually needed, and fluid losses can be compensated by drinking adequate fluids. However, in severely dehydrated adult patients, an oral rehydration solution can be given. Antidiarrhoeal and antiemetic medicines are not routinely needed because they do not prevent dehydration and do not improve nutritional status <em>(145)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Antibiotic treatment</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent"><strong>Antibiotics are not needed</strong> in most cases of acute diarrhoeal disease because they are of viral origin and the illness is usually self-limiting regardless of the causative pathogen. Rehydration is the main treatment for acute diarrhoeal disease <em>(145)</em>. Even in cases with severe dehydration, antibiotic treatment is not routinely needed.</p>

    <p>However, in patients with significant acute bloody diarrhoea and in severely immunocompromised patients, antibiotics may be given (see Table 14.6 for empiric options based on the risk of fluoroquinolone resistance). Bloody diarrhoea could be caused by certain strains of <em>Escherichia coli</em> (Shiga toxin-producing <em>Escherichia coli</em> also known as enterohaemorrhagic <em>Escherichia coli</em>). In these cases (mostly in children), the use of antibiotics is controversial because there is a theoretical concern that it could worsen symptoms of haemolytic uraemic syndrome, characterized by haemolytic anaemia, renal injury and low platelets. However as there is clear evidence of benefit in shigellosis, empiric treatment with antibiotics should not be withheld because of a concern of causing haemolytic uraemic syndrome.</p>

    <p>If symptoms do not resolve after 24–48 hours of antibiotic treatment, adding a treatment course of metronidazole for possible <em>Entamoeba histolytica</em> infection could be considered.</p>

    <p>In addition, antibiotic treatment should be considered in the context of cholera in the following cases (see Table 14.7 for antibiotic options):</p>

    <ul>
      <li><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_181" title="181" role="doc-pagebreak"/>suspected cholera in patients hospitalized with severe dehydration</li>

      <li>regardless of degree of dehydration: 

      <ul>
        <li>high purging or failure of first 4-hour course of rehydration therapy or</li>

        <li>coexisting conditions (e.g. pregnancy) or</li>

        <li>comorbidities (e.g. severe acute malnutrition, HIV infection) that pose elevated risk in cholera illness.</li>

    <p class="noindent">Key measures to prevent acute diarrhoeal diseases include access to safe drinking-water, use of improved sanitation, handwashing with soap, exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life, good personal and food hygiene, health education about how infections spread and vaccination against rotavirus, particularly in countries with a high rate of death associated with rotavirus <em>(146)</em>. Vaccination against cholera should also be considered, especially in endemic areas, in humanitarian crises (high risk of cholera) and during outbreaks. Vaccination against cholera should always be accompanied with other prevention and control strategies. Vaccination against measles could also substantially reduce the incidence and severity of diarrhoeal diseases and therefore every infant should be immunized against measles at the recommended age. For updated information on vaccination against rotavirus, cholera and measles, refer to the most recent WHO position papers <em>(147,149,153)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Definition</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Enteric fever is a severe systemic illness characterized by fever and abdominal pain caused by the bacterium <em>Salmonella enterica</em>, serotypes Typhi or Paratyphi.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_188" title="188" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Pathogen</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Enteric fever is caused by <em>Salmonella enterica</em> serotypes Typhi or Paratyphi A, B or C, a Gram-negative bacterium. Non-typhoidal <em>Salmonella</em> is not a cause of enteric fever but may cause infectious gastroenteritis, bloodstream infections, meningitis or bone and joint infections. Please refer to the relevant chapters if these infections are suspected.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Enteric fever is acquired through ingestion of food or water contaminated with <em>Salmonella</em> Typhi or Paratyphi or through direct contact with someone carrying the pathogen. Humans are the only source of these bacteria. Once the pathogen is ingested, it invades the intestinal mucosa primarily through the distal ileum. Once there, host immune defences are activated to eliminate the pathogen. However, these white cells can also act as carriers of the infection through the lymphatic system to the liver, spleen, bone marrow and lymph nodes, and ultimately to the bloodstream. Natural infection does not provide complete protection so recurrent illness is possible <em>(155)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Epidemiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Most cases of enteric fever are caused by <em>Salmonella</em> Typhi (70–80% of cases). Even though the absolute number of new cases of enteric fever has declined by 45% and the number of deaths by 41% since the 1990s, the disease is still endemic, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and in South Asia. Based on available data, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh are the countries with the highest incidence of enteric fever with &gt; 500 cases per 100 000 population in 2017. In 2017, about 14.3 million cases of enteric fever occurred worldwide. In endemic countries, children are affected the most with almost 60% of cases occurring in children younger than 15 years. Based on the data available, when appropriately treated with antibiotics, the case fatality rate for enteric fever is about 1% <em>(156)</em>. Complications (e.g. intestinal perforation) in hospitalized cases are estimated to occur in 20–30% of cases, with a higher risk in people presenting for care after having had symptoms for more than 10 days <em>(157)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Clinical presentation</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Symptoms of enteric fever are often non-specific, making it difficult to distinguish enteric fever from other febrile illnesses. As a result, misdiagnosis of cases can occur. In patients with enteric fever, protracted fever (≥ 38.0 °C for more than 3 days) is the main symptom. Headache is often present as well as loss of appetite and nausea. Gastrointestinal symptoms may not be present, and diarrhoea is seen more frequently in children and in people with HIV. The clinical presentation can vary from mild illness with a low-grade fever and malaise to severe disease presenting with septic shock and peritonitis because of intestinal bleeding <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_189" title="189" role="doc-pagebreak"/>and perforation. Encephalopathy can also occur in severe cases. Of note, clinical features are also not useful to distinguish infections caused by <em>Salmonella enterica</em>serotype Typhi from those caused by <em>Salmonella enterica</em> serotype Paratyphi.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Laboratory tests</strong></h2>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Patient microbiology tests</h3>

    <p class="noindent">In patients with suspected enteric fever, the diagnosis is largely dependent on the clinical presentation and detection of the pathogen in blood cultures, even though the sensitivity is low, especially when antibiotic treatment has already been started. <strong>A blood culture should be taken in all possible cases with fever requiring hospitalization, ideally before starting antibiotic treatment</strong>. Bone marrow cultures is the most sensitive diagnostic method, but these cultures are very rarely done because they are more difficult to perform and invasive. Stool cultures are usually negative in the early phases of the infection and therefore they are of limited diagnostic use (Table 15.1). Widal serology is still widely used in low- and middle-income countries; however, it is not a reliable method to diagnose acute illness because a positive result may represent a previous infection, and in returning travellers, vaccination prior to travel affects the results. Ideally the Widal serology requires two samples taken 10 days apart to demonstrate a four-fold rise of anti-<em>Salmonella</em> Typhi antibodies and this is not practical in many low-resource settings.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Using microbiology surveillance data</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Targeted clinical microbiological surveys of enteric fever-related bloodstream infection focusing on <em>Salmonella enterica</em> serotype Typhi and Paratyphi resistance rates may help inform local and national empiric antibiotic guidance.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Imaging</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Routine imaging is not needed.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Antibiotic treatment</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Antibiotic treatment options are shown in Table 15.2. In cases of enteric fever, antibiotic treatment should be started promptly because delays are associated with higher risk of complications and severe disease. In general, antibiotic treatment is given to shorten the duration of symptoms and to reduce the risk of complications, such as intestinal perforation and chronic carriage. Chronic carriers are asymptomatic people who continue to harbour the pathogen for months or even years after their initial infection and can transmit the infection. Fever usually decreases slowly, after around 3–5 days of effective treatment. Mild cases can be treated as outpatients with oral treatment, while severe cases should be treated as inpatients with systemic intravenous treatment.</p>

    <p>The choice of oral antibiotic, if possible, should be based on the sensitivity of the isolated pathogen. When choosing empiric treatment, the local prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance should be considered because of the increasing number of resistant isolates, mostly in Asia <em>(158)</em>. In these settings, a third-generation cephalosporin or azithromycin are appropriate options because resistance to these antibiotics is still low in most settings; &lt; 5% for ceftriaxone and only sporadic cases with resistance to azithromycin. Of note, antibiotics that were widely used in the 1980s and 1990s but fell into disuse because of resistance or toxicity concerns (e.g. ampicillin, chloramphenicol and sulfamethoxazole+trimethoprim) are again effective in some settings, mostly in Asia. However, the empiric use of these older options for treatment is discouraged because it could prompt a rebound of multidrug-resistant organisms.</p>

    <p>In recent years, outbreaks of enteric fever caused by extensively antibiotic-resistant <em>Salmonella</em> Typhi have been reported, for example, in Pakistan since 2016 <em>(159)</em>. These extensively antibiotic-resistant isolates are resistant to ampicillin, sulfamethoxazole+trimethoprim, chloramphenicol, fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins and represent a public health threat including the risk of travel/migration-related spread to other countries and regions.</p>

    <p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_191" title="191" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Step-down</strong> to oral treatment is based on improvement of symptoms and signs of infection and the ability to take oral antibiotics which allows discharge of the patient home when clinically appropriate.</p>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Combination treatment</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Currently, a single antibiotic regimen is recommended. However, the combination of a third-generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone) and azithromycin has been reported to reduce the duration of symptoms. This approach is suggested in some guidelines for severe cases <em>(160,161)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Prevention</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Access to safe water and adequate sanitation, health education, appropriate hygiene among food handlers and typhoid vaccination are all effective strategies for prevention and control of enteric fever. For updated information on vaccines to prevent enteric fever, please refer to the 2018 WHO position paper on typhoid vaccines <em>(154)</em>. Vaccination should be prioritized in countries with the highest burden of enteric fever (especially where antibiotic resistance is high) and in response to confirmed outbreaks. Single-dose typhoid conjugated vaccines are also available that can be used in younger children (from the age of 6 months onwards) and confer prolonged duration of protection. Recommendations on these newer vaccines can also be found in the 2018 WHO position paper <em>(154)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Definition</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">The terminology used to define skin and soft tissue infections has changed over the years. In general, the terms bacterial skin and soft tissue infections and bacterial skin and skin structures infections are often used interchangeably.</p>

    <p>While there is no universally accepted classification of skin infections, there are numerous ways to classify skin and soft tissue infections based on certain characteristics of the infection such as anatomic location (folliculitis, fasciitis, myositis), body location (e.g. extremities, face), timing (acute, chronic, recurrent), presence of tissue necrosis (necrotizing or not necrotizing), macroscopic presence of pus (purulent or non-purulent) or involvement <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_194" title="194" role="doc-pagebreak"/>of deep subcutaneous tissue and/or severity of disease (complicated or uncomplicated). Further classifications are based on the origin of the infection (bites, burns; see corresponding chapters) or host characteristics (e.g. immunosuppression, diabetes).</p>

    <p>A more recent definition by the United States Food and Drug Administration uses the term acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) to include a subset of conditions such as cellulitis and erysipelas, wound infections and major cutaneous abscesses, provided the area of the skin surface affected is at least 75 cm<sup>2</sup> . This definition was introduced “to assist sponsors developing drugs for the treatment of skin infections” and has limited clinical applicability outside trials <em>(165)</em>.</p>

    <p>This chapter focuses on the mild superficial forms of skin infections that do not affect deeper tissue layers: impetigo, erysipelas and cellulitis. For the more severe forms of skin and soft tissue infections, please refer to the corresponding chapters: necrotizing fasciitis, pyomyositis, burn wounds and severe infections with sepsis. The following syndromes are not covered in the current edition of the AWaRe book: acne, diabetic foot infections and surgical site infections.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Damage of the skin can lead to infections of the deeper layers beneath the epidermis. When such damage occurs, both endogenous pathogens (i.e. that naturally reside in the body) and exogenous pathogens (i.e. that enter the body from the environment) can penetrate the epidermis and spread to deeper structures through the lymphatic system. Depending on the depth of the infection, different clinical diseases can occur: impetigo and erysipelas (infections of the upper layer of the skin) and cellulitis (infection of the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue) (Figure 16.1). Cellulitis of the face can also occur as a consequence of local spreading of a dental infection, for example, dental abscess spreading to the surrounding soft tissue can result in cellulitis.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Epidemiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Bacterial skin infections occur worldwide and can affect all age groups; erysipelas is more frequent in children and elderly patients. In 2013, skin diseases (not limited to bacterial infections) were the fourth leading cause of non-fatal diseases <em>(166)</em>. Cellulitis, the most common skin infection, accounted for 0.04% (4 in 10 000) of the overall burden of all diseases combined in 2013. It was the only skin condition that showed a significant decrease (–13.2%) between 2005 and 2013 in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), a proxy for morbidity and mortality. This decrease was attributed to reduced mortality <em>(166)</em>. In 2017, the Global Burden of Disease study reported 43 million new cases of cellulitis worldwide <em>(44)</em>. Diabetes, peripheral arterial disease, HIV infection and other causes of immunosuppression are risk factors for severe skin infections.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Impetigo</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Impetigo is characterized by acute onset of superficial skin lesions usually without associated systemic symptoms. In most cases, impetigo presents with papules that progress to vesicles and pustules which break to finally form crusts (non-bullous form) (Figure 16.3). In a minority of cases (mostly in young children), vesicles develop to form larger bullae (bullous form).</p>

    <p class="noindent">Erysipelas is characterized by acute onset of a red skin lesion with well defined indurated margins, usually on the face or legs (Figure 16.4). Bullae may be present or develop in the first few days. The lesion is usually painful. Fever (≥ 38.0 °C) and other signs of systemic infection (e.g. tachycardia, leukocytosis) may be present.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Cellulitis</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">While erysipelas affects only the superficial skin layers and has clearly demarcated borders, cellulitis also affects subcutaneous tissues. Cellulitis is characterized by an acute onset of a skin lesion presenting with a combination of redness, swelling and induration, warmth and pain (or tenderness) of the affected area (see Figure 16.5). The condition can occur anywhere on the body, but predominantly affects the skin of the lower part of the legs and feet or the face.</p>

    <p>In patients with cellulitis, fever (≥ 38.0 °C) and other signs of systemic infection (e.g. tachycardia, leukocytosis) may be present. Skin redness alone may not indicate an infection, for example, redness is often present in patients with chronic venous stasis – bilateral versus unilateral involvement may indicate a non-infectious etiology, although bilateral cellulitis can occasionally occur. The severity of the infection should always be carefully assessed, especially to exclude the possibility of involvement of the muscular fascia (fasciitis). Facial and neck cellulitis, commonly arising from dental infection, can lead to potentially fatal deep space infections such as Ludwig angina. Cellulitis of the face can spread to the brain <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_202" title="202" role="doc-pagebreak"/>and lead to serious complications such as cavernous sinus thrombosis. These are medical emergencies but are overall rare.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Laboratory tests</strong></h2>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Patient microbiology tests</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Most mild cases of impetigo, erysipelas and cellulitis do not require routine microbiology tests. Surface swabs of intact, unbroken skin should not be taken in cases of erysipelas or cellulitis to avoid detecting pathogens that colonize the skin leading to unnecessary antibiotic treatment.</p>

    <p>Tissue swab cultures can be considered in certain cases (Table 16.3). For example, cultures could be done for lesions that are clearly purulent (therefore most likely due to <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>) to diagnose or exclude the presence of methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA). However, in many settings doing tissue swab cultures is not standard practice outside of the operating theatre. When swabs are taken, the lesion should always be cleaned and debrided before sample collection to identify the pathogens causing the infection and not colonizing organisms. For a correct interpretation of cultures, it is very important that the origin of the culture (exact location, superficial swab or intraoperatively obtained culture) is adequately documented.</p>

    <p>Cultures can be considered for chronic lesions such as diabetic foot infections (not covered in this chapter) to exclude the presence of multidrug-resistant organisms, for example, those producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs).</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Using microbiology surveillance data</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Routine surveillance is not helpful in informing empiric guidance.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Imaging</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Routine imaging of mild cases of impetigo, erysipelas and cellulitis is not necessary. However, initial imaging (e.g. ultrasound, X-ray) may be considered if an abscess or subdermal involvement are suspected. In these cases, management often requires a surgical approach, for example, incision and drainage in case of abscess and management of the primary dental cause.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Topical treatment (only for localized non-bullous impetigo)</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">For localized non-bullous impetigo, topical treatment could be considered as an alternative to oral antibiotics. This treatment can be as effective as oral antibiotic treatment and has the advantage that the risk of adverse events is minimal because of less systemic absorption <em>(168)</em>.</p>

    <p>Of the different topical treatments available, mupirocin ointment (2%) could be considered for a short course of treatment (5 days). However, widespread use of mupirocin can rapidly increase resistance to mupirocin in <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and limit its usefulness for targeted preventive purposes in carriers of <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>; mupirocin is active against both methicillin-susceptible <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and MRSA. Alternative treatments are available but they are not included in the EML and EMLc <em>(8,9)</em>. These alternatives are fusidic acid and hydrogen peroxide cream (1%). Topical corticosteroids should not be used routinely in these cases.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_204" title="204" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Antibiotic treatment (for widespread impetigo, erysipelas and cellulitis)</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">In most cases of mild infections, oral antibiotic treatment is adequate (Table 16.4). Empiric antibiotic options need to have good activity against the most likely pathogens (<em>Streptococcus</em> spp. and <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>). Empiric treatment against community-acquired MRSA may be considered in certain cases (e.g. clearly purulent lesions) based on individual risk factors (e.g. known MRSA colonization) and on the local prevalence of community-acquired MRSA. In these cases, the literature suggests using clindamycin or sulfamethoxazole+trimethoprim; these options are however not currently listed in the EML and EMLc for this indication.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Burns predispose to infection because they allow entry of pathogens from the patient’s own skin microbiota and the environment into the wound. Burns can also cause immunosuppression that allows rapid bacterial colonization and proliferation. Sepsis and septic shock are a frequent complication of severe burns.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Epidemiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Burn wounds are an important public health problem in low- and middle-income countries where they are among the leading causes of DALYs lost. An estimated 180 000 deaths every year are caused by burns and most occur in low- and middle-income countries <em>(170)</em>. Infections (including but not limited to the skin) are the most frequent complications encountered in patients with burn injuries and are the leading cause of death in patients with severe wounds. Skin infections (e.g. cellulitis) are in general the first infections to occur, usually in the first week of the injury.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Most likely pathogens</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Table 17.1 gives the pathogens that often infect burn wounds. In most cases, infection is caused by several pathogens. Multidrug-resistant organisms are a major concern in burn patients often because of prolonged hospitalization and frequent antibiotic exposure <em>(171)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Clinical presentation</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Diagnosis of a burn wound infection requires clinical examination. For this reason, burn wounds should be monitored for signs of infection, such as increased pain and redness or swelling of the area surrounding the wound. Redness alone may represent inflammation and does not necessarily indicate infection. Signs of invasive infection (e.g. change in the colour of the wound, signs of sepsis) should also be carefully monitored. Please also refer to the chapter on sepsis if suspected. Patients with burn injuries may also develop other complications dependent on their supportive care such as pneumonia, UTIs or catheter-related infections.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Laboratory tests</strong></h2>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Patient microbiology tests</h3>

    <p class="noindent">In mild cases of infection of a burn wound where there are no signs of systemic infection, routine testing (including wound cultures) is not required. These tests are not needed because identifying the causative pathogen in mild cases will not benefit the patient as it will not change management. In severe cases, blood cultures can be considered. Please also refer to the chapter on sepsis if suspected.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Other tests</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Routine testing in mild cases with no signs of systemic infection is not required. In addition, because of the inflammatory response associated with the burn itself, results of laboratory tests (e.g. biomarkers of infection) may be of limited help.</p>

    <p>In severe cases, certain laboratory tests can be considered to make an initial assessment of the patient and to help guide the duration of antibiotic treatment. Please also refer to the chapter on sepsis if suspected.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_212" title="212" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Using microbiology surveillance data</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Targeted clinical surveys of bloodstream infection isolates at a local unit level may be helpful to inform empiric guidance. Empiric guidance should not usually be informed by routine surface skin swabs.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Imaging</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Routine imaging is not required unless a complication is suspected.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Management</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Irrigation and debridement of necrotic tissue to prevent infection of the burn wound is suggested. Appropriate daily cleaning and dressing of the wound are the cornerstone of treatment.</p>

    <p>Infection control procedures should be meticulously observed to prevent transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Topical treatment</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Local antiseptics could be considered based on local protocols.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Preventive antibiotic use</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Routine use of antibiotics to prevent infection in burn wounds should be avoided if there are no signs of systemic infection or in otherwise healthy patients. Use of antibiotics as a preventive treatment is controversial because there is no clear evidence that it can prevent infection <em>(172,173)</em>. In addition, such use can lead to colonization with resistant microorganisms, so caution is needed.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Antibiotic treatment</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Empiric treatment of mild infections should include antibiotics with good activity against the most likely pathogens, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and <em>Streptococcus</em> spp. Antibiotic options are shown in Table 17.2. Empiric treatment against community-acquired MRSA may be considered and should be based on local prevalence of invasive isolates and individual patient risk factors (e.g. known MRSA colonization).</p>

    <p class="noindent">It is important to note that because hospital-acquired multidrug-resistant organisms are frequently found in burn units, the results of microbiology cultures should where possible guide antibiotic treatment. Empiric use of RESERVE group antibiotics should, however, generally be avoided unless there is a high suspicion of the infection being caused by multidrug-resistant organisms. Please also refer to the chapter on sepsis if suspected.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Skin wounds include any traumatic injury characterized by damage to and exposure of deeper skin tissue. Examples of skin wounds include those caused by human or animal bites or burns, road traffic injuries, and gunshot and stab wounds. The severity of the clinical findings can vary from mild wounds with no systemic involvement to severe infections including tetanus (infection by <em>Clostridium tetani</em>) and gas gangrene (infection by gas-producing bacteria such as <em>Clostridium perfringens</em>).</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_221" title="221" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Skin wounds predispose to infection because they facilitate entry of pathogens from the patient’s own skin microbiota and the environment into the wound. With bites, pathogens from the oral cavity of the biting animal can also penetrate the skin.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Epidemiology</strong></h2>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Traumatic wounds</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Road traffic injuries occur worldwide but the majority of deaths (&gt; 90%) occur in low- and middle-income countries. Overall each year about 1.3 million people die as a result of road traffic incidents with many more suffering from non-fatal injuries (between 20 and 50 million people) <em>(177,182)</em>. In people younger than 30 years, this is the leading cause of death.</p>

    <p>In 2016, the Global Burden of Disease study reported about 251 000 deaths from firearm injuries globally (outside of war settings), the majority caused by homicides (64%), followed by suicides (27%) and unintentional firearm deaths (9%). Overall, the global age-standardized rate of firearm deaths decreased by about 0.9% a year between 1990 and 2016 with differences between countries. Most firearm injury deaths occur among people aged 20 to 24 years <em>(183)</em>.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Bite wounds</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Human and animal bites occur worldwide; most cases are caused by animals (dogs in &gt; 90% of cases) <em>(184)</em>. Less frequently, bites are caused by other mammals such as cats, rodents (e.g. rats, mice) and bats. In certain countries (e.g. in Africa and in South-East Asia), snake and monkey bites are also frequently reported. Children are more likely to have animal bites <em>(185)</em>. The risk of developing a bacterial infection from a dog bite is unclear and depends on many different factors related to the patient (i.e. the person bitten), the characteristics of the bite (depth, location) and the initial management of the bite. However, available data suggest that in 10–20% of cases of dog bites, the wound will become infected <em>(185,186)</em>. In comparison, wounds caused by cat bites have a higher risk of becoming infected (up to 50%) because of the deeper penetration of their teeth <em>(185,186)</em>.</p>

    <p>Animal bites are a significant risk factor for transmission of rabies, especially in settings where prophylaxis with rabies vaccine in domestic and wild animals is not routinely given. The Global Burden of Disease study estimated 13 400 new cases of rabies worldwide in 2017 <em>(44)</em>. Deaths from rabies and dog bites are a problem mostly in low- and middle-income countries where post-exposure treatment and appropriate access to health care may be lacking <em>(184)</em>.</p>

Rodents (mostly rats) are also responsible for an appreciable proportion of bites to humans <em>(187)</em>. Rat bites primarily affect people (mostly children &lt; 5 years) living in poorer conditions in rat-infested environments, including in high-income countries. Most bites occur on the face and hands and usually occur at night while sleeping. Although rare, rat bites can cause severe infections, such as rat-bite fever, caused by <em>Streptobacillus moniliformis</em>or <em>Spirillum minus</em>. Tetanus infection can also be caused by bites and it should be considered in patients who have not been immunized against the infection. In 2019, almost 15 000 cases of tetanus were reported globally <em>(188)</em>.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Wounds range in severity from minor superficial abrasions to deep wounds with involvement and destruction of the deep tissues. An infection may or may not be present at the time of clinical evaluation. Usually, signs and symptoms of infection appear &gt; 12 hours after the injury. Superficial infections may manifest with signs and symptoms of cellulitis characterized by redness, swelling, warmth, lymphangitis and pain of the area surrounding the wound. Fever (≥ 38.0 °C) may be present. Patients should also be carefully monitored for signs of invasive infection, for example, change in colour of the wound due to necrosis and signs of sepsis.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Laboratory tests</strong></h2>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Patient microbiology tests</h3>

    <p class="noindent">In mild cases with no signs of systemic infection, routine testing, including wound cultures, is not required. These tests are not needed because identifying the causative pathogen in mild cases is rare even when microbiology tests are performed, most infections are polymicrobial and microbiology results will not affect management of the condition in most cases.</p>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Initial management of wounds</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Routine use of antibiotics to prevent infection of the wound is not required in most cases (unless there are systemic signs of infection in which case antibiotics would be used as treatment and not as prophylaxis) and should be discouraged.</p>

    <p>Preventive antibiotic use may be considered in very few specific cases where the potential risk of infection is judged to outweigh the risk of overusing antibiotics.</p>

    <p>These cases include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Wounds in high-risk clinical areas (e.g. face, hands, areas near a joint)</li>

      <li>Severely immunocompromised patients.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>However, there is no clear evidence that use of antibiotics can prevent infection after a wound has occurred, including bite wounds. In addition, such use exposes the patient to the negative effects of antibiotics, for example, alteration of the intestinal microbiota, and selection of resistant microorganisms.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Antibiotic treatment</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">If signs and symptoms of infection are present, empiric treatment should include antibiotics with good activity against the most likely pathogens, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and <em>Streptococcus</em> spp. and anaerobic organisms. With animal bites, the type of animal should also be considered (see Table 18.2), but in general, empiric treatment against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria is required, since most infections are caused by multiple pathogens (polymicrobial infections). Empiric treatment against community-acquired MRSA is usually not required. If cellulitis around the wound develops, refer to the chapter on bacterial impetigo, erysipelas and cellulitis. Antibiotic options for empiric treatment are given in Table 18.4.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_233" title="233" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Pathogen</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Chlamydial urogenital infection is caused by <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em>, an intracellular Gram-negative bacterium. There are several strains of <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> and not all are associated with STI (see the chapter on trachoma). Chlamydial urogenital infections associated with STI are caused mostly by genital tract biovars (serovars D to K) and, more rarely, lymphogranuloma venereum biovar (serovars L1, L2, L3). Lymphogranuloma venereum is an ulcerative disease extending to regional lymph nodes (often the inguinal and anorectal area) and is more common in men (see the paragraph on lymphogranuloma venereum later in this chapter). This disease is endemic in many tropical and sub-tropical regions; in other settings, the infection is most commonly seen among men who have sex with men.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent"><em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> infects the mucosa of the urogenital tract during sexual contact and produces a local inflammatory response that causes vaginal, urethral or anal discharge. Invasive infections caused by more invasive serovars of <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> can also spread to regional lymph nodes.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Epidemiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Chlamydial urogenital infection is one of the most common STIs worldwide, including in low-income settings where it is probably under-reported <em>(194,195)</em>. Young sexually active adults are at particularly high risk. Undiagnosed and untreated, chlamydial urogenital infections can lead to complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease (infection of the upper female reproductive tract), ectopic pregnancy and infertility in women <em>(196,197)</em>. Maternal infection can cause serious health problems to the child, such as preterm birth, low birth weight or conjunctivitis. The 2021 WHO global progress report on HIV, viral hepatitis and STIs reported an estimated 128 million new chlamydial infections in 2020 among adults aged 15 to 49 years <em>(193)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Clinical presentation</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Signs and symptoms of chlamydial infection mostly overlap with those of gonococcal infection.</p>

    <p class="noindent">In most cases, the infection is asymptomatic, and it is therefore impossible to determine how long a person has been infected. Even in the absence of symptoms, infected individuals can transmit the infection.</p>

    <p class="noindent">When symptoms occur (usually 1–2 weeks after being infected), particularly in men, the most common clinical presentation is acute urethritis characterized by profuse usually clear urethral discharge and dysuria. Most women with chlamydial cervical infection are <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_234" title="234" role="doc-pagebreak"/>asymptomatic. The ones who may be symptomatic have vaginal discharge, dyspareunia (painful intercourse) and dysuria. Some women may have lower abdominal pain or pelvic tenderness because of ascending infection, causing pelvic inflammatory disease.</p>

    <p class="noindent">In both sexes (but in males more than females), symptoms of acute proctitis with pain, pruritus, discharge and bleeding of the rectum may occur. Pharyngitis (mostly manifesting as a mild sore throat) and conjunctivitis are other conditions that usually coexist with genital infection.</p>

    <p class="noindent"><strong>Lymphogranuloma venereum</strong> is characterized by inguinal or femoral lymphadenopathy (usually unilateral) with or without an associated primary lesion. The classic lesion is a transient, ulcerative lesion or a papule usually located on the genitalia or rectum. In many cases, the lesion may remain unnoticed; for example, the infection may be completely asymptomatic in women when located on the cervix or can sometimes present with symptoms of acute urethritis in men. Rectal exposure can cause proctitis with pain, pruritus, discharge and bleeding of the rectum.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Laboratory tests</strong></h2>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Patient microbiology tests</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Molecular testing has greatly improved the detection of <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> (and <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em>) among both symptomatic and asymptomatic men and women. Molecular testing has become the recommended reference standard technology to diagnose and screen populations for <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> and <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em>. Table 19.1 indicates the types of specimens that can be used for this purpose.</p>

    <p class="noindent">For more comprehensive information on the diagnosis of chlamydial infection, please refer to the most recent (2013) WHO guideline for the laboratory diagnosis of STIs <em>(192)</em>. Please check the WHO website regularly for possible updates.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Patients with chlamydial urogenital infection should be offered testing for HIV and other STIs, such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, gonococcal infection and syphilis. Test of cure (i.e. testing after the end of treatment) could be considered in pregnant women 3–4 weeks after the end of treatment.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Tests to consider when chlamydial infection is suspected are listed in Table 19.1. Additional tests for other STIs that could be considered when chlamydial urogenital infection is confirmed or suspected are shown in Table 19.2. Surveillance, including etiologic studies of STI syndromes, will be important to inform local and national guidance.</p>

    <p class="noindent">If symptoms persist at review, partner notification and treatment history should be checked. People with recurrent or persistent infection should be referred to a centre with laboratory capacity to diagnose <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em>, <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em>, <em>Mycoplasma genitalium</em> and <em>Trichomonas vaginalis</em> and to test for antibiotic-resistant <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> and <em>Mycoplasma genitalium</em>.</p>

              <p class="legenda"><sup>b</sup> Possible specimens among women, are a vulvovaginal specimen, which may be self-collected. An endocervical swab can also be an alternative but requires a speculum. First-catch urine is another option, but the sensitivity and specificity tend to be lower in women. Among men, possible specimens are first-catch urine or urethral swabs. Anorectal and pharyngeal samples are also adequate. For anorectal samples among men who have sex with men, <em>Chlamydia</em>genovar testing for lymphogranuloma venereum should be done to guide the appropriate treatment regimen for this condition.</p>

              <p class="legenda"><sup>c</sup> Possible specimens are urethral swabs, endocervical swabs, vaginal swabs, rectal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs and conjunctival swabs. Note. Urine samples are not good specimens for microscopy and culture.</p>

    <p class="noindent">When chlamydial urogenital infection is suspected, imaging is not usually needed.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Antibiotic treatment</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Antibiotic treatment is always indicated when the infection is diagnosed. Table 19.3 gives recommendations taken from the 2016 WHO guidelines on the treatment of chlamydial infections <em>(190)</em> and the 2021 WHO guidelines on the management of symptomatic STIs <em>(191)</em>. Please check the WHO website regularly for possible updates. Recommendations in the EML overlap with the WHO guidelines (azithromycin or doxycycline are the recommended treatment options) but fewer treatment alternatives are included in the EML <em>(8)</em>.</p>

    <p>If symptoms persist at review:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>check partner notification and treatment history; and</li>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Prevention</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Important elements of prevention include counselling and behavioural approaches including comprehensive sexuality education, pre- and post-test counselling, safe sex and risk reduction counselling and promoting consistent use of condoms. Interventions targeting high-risk groups (e.g. men who have sex with men, transgender people, sex workers, people who inject drugs) may be considered. Also consider offering pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV to people at high risk of HIV infection. Sexual partners should always be informed of the infection and treated <em>(189)</em>. Reporting of this infection to health authorities according to local regulations should also be done.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Gonococcal infection is an STI caused by the bacterium <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Pathogen</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent"><em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em>, the organism causing gonorrhoea, is a Gram-negative bacterium.</p>

    <p>The bacterium easily develops resistance to antibiotics, which has led to infections that are difficult to treat. As a result, resistance to antibiotics used for treatment (including third-generation cephalosporins) is a serious problem worldwide. Therefore, in 2012, WHO launched a global action plan to control the spread and impact of resistance in <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> <em>(201)</em>.</p>

    <p>Data on <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> resistance are collected through the WHO Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS) and the WHO Global Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme (GASP network) and are regularly published <em>(202–205)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent"><em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> usually enters the mucosa (mostly of the genital tract) during sexual contact. Because of its many virulence factors, this bacterium can adapt to the local environment, evade immune response mechanisms and proliferate causing local inflammatory response and disease and, more rarely, systemic infection (i.e. gonococcal bacteraemia). If left untreated, or if it is inappropriately treated, complications may occur. In particular in women, pelvic inflammatory disease (i.e. an infection of the upper female reproductive tract) with inflammation of the uterine tubes (i.e. salpingitis), endometrium (i.e. endometritis) or abscess formation in the ovary/ovaries and tubes can occur. In men, complications include epididymitis and periurethritis with abscess formation. These complications can lead to infertility.</p>

    <p>Disseminated gonococcal infection can occur as a result of bacteraemia secondary to mucosal infection (mostly of the genital tract) and can lead to arthritis, skin manifestations and other complications.</p>

    <p>Infants of mothers with gonococcal infection can be infected at delivery, resulting in neonatal conjunctivitis which manifests as purulent ocular discharge and swollen eyelids. Untreated conjunctivitis may lead to scarring and blindness.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Epidemiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Gonococcal infection is one of the most common STIs worldwide.</p>

    <p>The 2021 WHO global progress report on HIV, viral hepatitis and STIs reported an estimated 82 million new gonococcal infections in 2020 among adults aged 15 to 49 years <em>(193)</em>.</p>

    <p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_246" title="246" role="doc-pagebreak"/>The highest incidence of gonococcal infection is in the Africa and Western Pacific regions; this includes China and Australia among others <em>(206)</em>. Gonococcal infection increases the risk of HIV infection two- or three-fold.</p>

    <p>Risk factors for gonococcal infection include HIV infection, young age, having multiple sexual partners or a new sexual partner, having partners with STIs, having had previous gonococcal infection and/or other STIs and several socioeconomic factors, such as low socioeconomic or educational level or substance abuse. Infection does not induce protective immunity therefore reinfection is possible. Resistance of <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> to antibiotics used to treat the infection is a concern; see the pathogen section for more information about resistance <em>(204)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Clinical presentation</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Signs and symptoms of gonococcal infection vary in men and women and overlap with those of chlamydial infection. Some people with gonococcal infection may be asymptomatic even though they can still transmit the infection. When symptoms occur (usually a few days after being infected), the most common clinical presentation in men is acute urethritis characterized by profuse mucopurulent urethral discharge and dysuria; testicular discomfort can also be present. In women, mucopurulent vaginal discharge and dysuria are the most common symptoms. Several women may have lower abdominal pain because of ascending infection causing pelvic inflammatory disease. Gonorrhoea causes cervical infection that presents with cervical discharge, cervical ectopy and friability and easy bleeding on contact.</p>

    <p>In both sexes (but in males more than females), symptoms of acute proctitis with pain, pruritus, discharge and bleeding of the rectum may occur. Pharyngitis (mostly manifesting as a mild sore throat) and conjunctivitis are other conditions that usually coexist with genital infection.</p>

    <p>Rarely, the infection can disseminate (i.e. gonococcal bacteraemia) and this can typically lead to localized infection in one or more joints (i.e. gonococcal arthritis). Please refer to the chapter on septic arthritis for more information on this topic.</p>

    <p>In pregnant women, the infection can be transmitted to the child during vaginal delivery. In newborns, gonococcal infection can present with acute ocular infection (i.e. conjunctivitis) or pharyngitis which manifest a few days after birth. Disseminated infection with septic arthritis (usually with multiple joints involved) can also occur in newborns.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Laboratory tests</strong></h2>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Patient microbiology tests</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Molecular testing has greatly improved the detection of <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> and <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> among both symptomatic and asymptomatic men and women. Molecular testing has become the recommended gold standard technology to diagnose <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_247" title="247" role="doc-pagebreak"/>and screen populations for <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> and <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em>. Table 20.1 indicates the types of specimens that can be used for this purpose.</p>

    <p>Culture of <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> is still the standard method for performing antibiotic susceptibility testing. However, this organism is not easy to grow in the laboratory and requires special training and a special culture medium. For this reason, culture of <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> is not routinely performed as part of managing people with gonococcal infection in resource-limited settings.</p>

    <p><em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> can also be identified by light microscopy of Gram-stained samples and a presumptive diagnosis can be made if intracellular Gram-negative diplococci are observed in polymorphonuclear leukocytes, best seen when there is a urethral discharge. Gram-stained smears from the cervix are also considered positive for the presumptive diagnosis of gonorrhoea in women if intracellular Gram-negative diplococci are observed in polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Gram stain of urethral samples among women has low yield and may not be cost-effective.</p>

    <p>For more comprehensive information on the diagnosis of gonococcal infection, please refer to the most recent (2013) WHO guideline for the laboratory diagnosis of STIs <em>(192)</em>. Please check the WHO website regularly for possible updates. Patients with gonococcal infection are also usually evaluated for other STIs, such as chlamydial infection, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV infection and syphilis.</p>

    <p>Tests to consider when gonococcal infection is suspected are listed in Table 20.1. Additional tests for other STIs that could be considered when gonococcal infection is confirmed or suspected are shown in Table 20.2.</p>

    <p>Important elements of prevention include counselling and behavioural approaches including comprehensive sexuality education, pre- and post-test counselling, safe sex and risk reduction counselling and promoting consistent use of condoms. Interventions targeting high-risk groups (e.g. men who have sex with men, transgender people, sex workers, people who inject drugs) and offering HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis to people at high risk of HIV infection may be considered. Sexual partners should always be informed of the infection and treated. Reporting of this infection to health authorities according to local regulations should also be done.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Syphilis is an STI caused by the bacterium <em>Treponema pallidum</em> subspecies <em>pallidum</em>. Syphilis is one of other treponematoses, that is, diseases caused by spirochaetes of the species <em>Treponema pallidum</em>. Other <em>Treponema pallidum</em> subspecies causing human diseases include subspecies <em>pertenue</em>, the causative pathogen of yaws <em>(212)</em>, subspecies <em>endemicum</em>, the causative pathogen of endemic syphilis or bejel, and subspecies <em>carateum</em>, the causative pathogen of pinta <em>(213)</em>. This chapter will only address disease caused by <em>Treponema pallidum</em> subspecies <em>pallidum</em> (syphilis). Information about other treponematoses is available on the WHO website <em>(212)</em>.</p>

    <p>Syphilis can be classified as early or late based on the time since becoming infected. Usually infections of ≤ 2 years duration are defined as early and infections of &gt; 2 years are defined as late. Furthermore, infections can be classified as primary, secondary or tertiary based on the clinical presentation <em>(210)</em>. There is usually a long latent phase with no clinical manifestations between secondary and tertiary infection; the tertiary phase only develops in untreated or inadequately treated infections. Overlap between these definitions exists, with early infection including primary and secondary syphilis and late infection including the latent phase and tertiary syphilis.</p>

    <p>The latent phase can also be divided into two phases – early latent and late latent. Early latent syphilis is usually defined as infection of &lt; 2 years, whereas late latent syphilis is defined as the presence of the disease of ≥ 2 years <em>(210)</em>. However, this distinction is difficult to apply because it is often impossible to establish the time of the initial infection.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_258" title="258" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Pathogen</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Syphilis is caused by <em>Treponema pallidum</em> subspecies <em>pallidum</em>, a bacterium of the phylum Spirochaetes; other members of this phylum include <em>Leptospira</em> and <em>Borrelia</em>.</p>

    <p><em>Treponema pallidum</em> is characterized by slow growth, difficulty in culturing in vitro, and its thinness – 0.2 μm compared to about 0.5 μm for a bacterium like <em>Escherichia coli</em> – which makes it difficult to see with conventional microscopy.</p>

    <p>Resistance to penicillin has not yet been reported and therefore it remains the antibiotic of choice for the treatment of syphilis. Resistance to azithromycin has been reported in some settings <em>(214)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Syphilis is usually acquired through sexual contact with infectious lesions on the mucosa or skin or, much more rarely, through the bloodstream. The infection can also be transmitted from the mother to her fetus because <em>Treponema pallidum</em> subspecies <em>pallidum</em> can cross the placenta and cause fetal death and congenital infection.</p>

    <p>With sexual transmission, once <em>Treponema pallidum</em> subspecies <em>pallidum</em> enters the subcutaneous tissue, infection develops within 2–6 weeks (usually about 3 weeks) with formation of an ulcerative lesion that occurs at the site of inoculation. Usually, the immune system is able to control the early infection and, even if left untreated, the primary ulcerative lesion (i.e. chancre) resolves. However, dissemination of <em>Treponema pallidum</em> through the bloodstream can occur at the time of primary infection and this can result over time in secondary or tertiary syphilis in the absence of adequate treatment. In particular, tertiary syphilis has a long incubation period (up to years or decades after the initial infection) and develops in about a third of patients with untreated syphilis. In 2017, 370 000 prevalent cases of tertiary syphilis were reported worldwide but this number is probably an underestimation of the true burden of the disease <em>(44)</em>.</p>

    <p>Congenital syphilis can occur as a result of vertical transmission of the pathogen from an infected mother to the fetus. The risk of transmission depends on a combination of factors, including maternal titres of non-treponemal tests (see Table 21.1 for an explanation about tests), timing, adequacy of maternal treatment and stage of maternal infection. The estimated total number of cases of congenital syphilis worldwide in 2016 was 661 000, or 473 per 100 000 live births <em>(215)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Epidemiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Syphilis is a common curable STI and its incidence is increasing globally. WHO estimates there were 7 million new cases in 2020 <em>(193)</em>. Other bacterial STIs occur more frequently, for <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_259" title="259" role="doc-pagebreak"/>example, in 2020 more than 82 million new cases of gonorrhoea and about 128 million new cases of chlamydial infection were reported <em>(193)</em>. However, syphilis has an important public health impact because of the potential serious consequences if left untreated, including maternal transmission to the fetus resulting in congenital syphilis and fetal death, and complications such as neurosyphilis and cardiovascular syphilis.</p>

    <p>Moreover, as with other STIs, syphilis affects quality of life and increases the risk of transmitting or acquiring other STIs including HIV infection. This HIV risk is of particular concern because STIs characterized by the presence of ulcerative lesions have the highest risk of HIV transmission <em>(216)</em>.</p>

    <p>The risk factors for syphilis include: having multiple sexual partners or a new sexual partner; having partners with STIs; having had a previous STI; and several socioeconomic factors, such as low socioeconomic or educational level, substance abuse and young age <em>(217,218)</em>. Lack of access to adequate prenatal care is an important risk factor for congenital syphilis.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Clinical presentation</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Signs and symptoms of syphilis vary depending on the stage of the disease, early or late.</p>

    <p>Early syphilis has the following signs and symptoms.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Primary infection (localized disease). This is characterized by the presence of a localized non-painful ulcerative lesion (i.e. chancre) with indurated margins, usually associated with local lymphadenopathy. The lesion is usually located on the genitalia, mouth or rectum but other locations are possible depending on the site of inoculation. The lesion is often asymptomatic and can remain unnoticed, particularly among women. If left untreated, the lesion usually resolves within a few weeks without leaving a scar.</li>

      <li>Secondary infection (disseminated disease). This is characterized by skin and mucosal manifestations. Generally, a maculopapular non-irritant rash appears which is usually diffuse and extends bilaterally over the trunk and the extremities. A characteristic feature is the involvement of the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The mucous membranes of the mouth and perineum can also show lesions (mostly flat lesions) that are highly infectious. Systemic manifestations (e.g. fever ≥ 38.0 °C, generalized lymphadenopathy and malaise) are usually present. Neurological manifestations (e.g. meningitis), hepatitis and ocular involvement can also occur in this phase.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Late syphilis has the following signs and symptoms.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Tertiary syphilis (disseminated disease). This can occur as the result of an untreated early syphilis after a period of latency, with no clinical manifestations, that may last <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_260" title="260" role="doc-pagebreak"/>years. Usually tertiary syphilis develops more rapidly in patients with HIV. In this phase, different organ systems can be affected, particularly: the cardiovascular system (typically with signs and symptoms of aortitis); the skin, soft tissues and bones (typically with granulomatous or nodular lesions also known as gummas); and the central nervous system (typically with symptoms of progressive dementia, psychiatric syndrome and tabes dorsalis, which is characterized by problems with coordination of movements, pain radiating from the spine and impaired response of the pupils to light).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Congenital syphilis infection during pregnancy can lead to spontaneous abortion or premature birth. Most babies with congenital syphilis are asymptomatic at birth but when symptoms are present, they usually develop days or weeks after birth. These symptoms often include anaemia, thrombocytopenia, rash (maculopapular, desquamative rash particularly over the palms, soles, mouth and anus), generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly and jaundice, nasal discharge (that may turn bloody), painful osteitis (mostly in long bones) and teeth abnormalities. The cerebrospinal fluid is abnormal, indicating neurological disease, in up to half of all babies. Of note, neurological consequences can be expressed later in life and this should always be considered with congenital syphilis.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Laboratory tests</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">For more comprehensive information on diagnosis of syphilis, please refer to the most recent (2013) WHO guideline for the laboratory diagnosis of STIs <em>(192)</em>. Please check the WHO website regularly for possible updates.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Patient microbiology tests</h3>

    <p class="noindent">In patients with suspected syphilis, microbiology tests can support the diagnosis (Table 21.1). Certain microbiology tests are also used to screen asymptomatic pregnant women. For screening during pregnancy, please refer to the most recent (2017) WHO guideline on syphilis screening and treatment for pregnant women <em>(211)</em>.</p>

    <p class="H4---B">Direct detection methods</p>

    <p class="noindent">These methods can be used to detect the pathogen in specimens obtained from skin or tissues lesions (Table 21.1). Direct detection methods include: dark-field microscopy where <em>Treponema pallidum</em> from lesions of primary syphilis can be observed (of note, a negative dark-field result does not exclude syphilis); and nucleic acid amplification tests to detect DNA sequences specific to <em>Treponema pallidum</em>. Direct detection is considered the gold standard but it is much less frequently used today because it is more time-consuming than serological tests.</p>

    <p class="H4---B"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_261" title="261" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Serological tests</p>

    <p class="noindent">Two types of serological test can be used, treponemal and non-treponemal.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Treponemal tests detect antibodies to treponemal antigens and usually remain positive after infection even after successful treatment. These tests include: fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test; <em>Treponema pallidum</em> particle agglutination <em/>assay; and <em>Treponema pallidum</em> haemagglutination assay. Treponemal rapid diagnostic tests for syphilis are available and prequalified by WHO.</li>

      <li>Non-treponemal tests detect antibodies that react to lipids, for example, cardiolipin released during cellular damage that occurs in response to <em>Treponema pallidum</em>. These are qualitative and quantitative tests that can also be used to monitor response to treatment because their titres tend to decline after adequate treatment and may become negative (i.e. non-reactive) over time. These tests include: rapid plasma reagin test and Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Initially, a two-step approach is used to test for syphilis and both types of tests – treponemal and non-treponemal – need to be positive to confirm the diagnosis. In order to increase access to testing and ensure same-day treatment, WHO recommends the use of a rapid treponemal test followed (if positive) by a non-treponemal test.</p>

    <p>However, starting with a non-treponemal test and confirmation of positive results with a treponemal test is also appropriate.</p>

    <p>All serological tests for syphilis (non-treponemal and treponemal tests) are negative in the early phase of primary syphilis and take 1–4 weeks after the chancre appears to become reactive. Both treponemal and non-treponemal tests are reactive in secondary or tertiary syphilis.</p>

    <p>Non-treponemal tests can rarely give false positive results, for example, during pregnancy or during an acute febrile illness. Figure 21.1 and Figure 21.2 and Table 21.2 can be used to help with the interpretation of the results of serological tests.</p>

    <p>Additional tests for other STIs that could be considered when syphilis is confirmed or suspected are shown in Table 21.3.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_267" title="267" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Imaging</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">When syphilis is suspected, imaging is not usually needed unless a complication of late syphilis is suspected.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Antibiotic treatment</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">All patients, including pregnant women, diagnosed with syphilis should receive a full course of antibiotic treatment. Serological response to treatment can be assessed by repeating a non-treponemal quantitative test – ideally the same type of non-treponemal test used at the time of diagnosis – to detect a reduction in titre. A four-fold reduction, or higher, in titres should be seen to confirm an adequate response to treatment for early syphilis. Usually assessments are repeated at 3, 6 and 12 months after the end of treatment.</p>

    <p>In the case of early syphilis (primary or secondary), the partners of infected people should also be treated if they had sexual relations with the infected person in the 90 days before the person was diagnosed with syphilis. If more than 90 days have elapsed, serological testing is usually suggested and treatment is given accordingly.</p>

    <p>The antibiotic treatment recommendations reported here (Table 21.5) are aligned with the most recent WHO guidelines for the treatment of syphilis and for the management of symptomatic STIs <em>(191,210)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Prevention</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Sexual transmission typically occurs only during primary, secondary and early latent infection. Mother-to-child transmission, however, has been documented to occur up to several years after the initial infection <em>(210)</em>.</p>

    <p>Prevention of infection is a key strategy; no effective vaccine against <em>Treponema pallidum</em> is yet available therefore other preventive measures can be used.</p>

    <p>The main elements of prevention include: comprehensive sexuality education, pre- and post-test counselling, safe sex and risk reduction counselling, and promoting consistent use of condoms. Interventions targeting groups who have a higher risk of infection – for example, men who have sex with men, transgender people, sex workers, people who inject drugs, indigenous communities and people in prison – should be considered. Offering HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis to people at high risk of HIV infection may be considered.</p>

    <p>Access of pregnant women to early and adequate prenatal care, including screening at first visit and immediate treatment initiation if needed, are key to prevent congenital syphilis.</p>

    <p>Sexual partners should always be informed of the infection and treated <em>(189)</em>. Reporting of this infection to health authorities according to local regulations should also be done.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Trichomoniasis is caused by <em>Trichomonas vaginalis</em>, an anaerobe flagellated protozoan.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent"><em>Trichomonas vaginalis</em> infects the mucosa of the urogenital tract during sexual contact and produces a local inflammatory response that causes vaginal or urethral discharge.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Epidemiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Trichomoniasis is the most prevalent STI worldwide with an estimated 156 million new cases in 2020 as reported by WHO <em>(193)</em>.</p>

    <p class="noindent">The infection most commonly affects women older than 40 years. As with other STIs, the risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV is higher in cases of trichomoniasis and the infection is associated with adverse outcomes in pregnancy, such as preterm delivery, premature rupture of membranes and low birth weight <em>(220)</em>. If left untreated, trichomoniasis can persist for months or years and in pregnant women, it can be transmitted to the baby during delivery. Common risk factors for infection include multiple sex partners, a history of having other STIs (e.g. HIV infection) and substance abuse.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Clinical presentation</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Most cases of trichomoniasis are asymptomatic, especially in men, or have mild symptoms. In women, symptoms include acute onset of vaginal inflammation and discharge (usually characterized by a bad smell and with a frothy appearance), dysuria and pelvic pain. In men, symptomatic infection usually presents with urethral discharge, dysuria, and testicular discomfort or pain. Epididymitis and prostatitis can also occur in a minority of cases.</p>

    <p class="noindent">For more comprehensive information on the diagnosis of trichomoniasis, please refer to the most recent (2013) WHO guideline on the laboratory diagnosis of STIs <em>(192)</em>. Please check the WHO website regularly for possible updates.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Patient microbiology tests</h3>

    <p class="noindent">All people with trichomoniasis are also usually evaluated for other STIs, such as chlamydial infection, gonococcal infection, hepatitis B and hepatitis C, HIV infection and syphilis.</p>

    <p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_274" title="274" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Tests to consider when trichomoniasis is suspected are indicated in Table 22.1.</p>

    <p>Molecular assays such as nucleic acid amplification tests have the highest sensitivity of all diagnostic methods to detect <em>Trichomonas vaginalis</em> but they are not currently widely available as rapid point-of-care tests. However, if available, they should be used. Vaginal swabs are the samples of choice, but endocervical samples and urine can be used for some assays.</p>

    <p>Historically, trichomoniasis has been diagnosed by performing wet mount microscopy. Although this is not the gold standard technique, a wet mount is frequently used because it is quick, inexpensive and easy to perform. However, to have a good chance of successfully identifying the motile trichomonads, the slide should be read within 10 minutes of collection of the sample since trichomonads quickly lose their motility. Non-motile cells cannot be diagnosed as trichomonads due to possible misidentification; for example, a non-motile trichomonad is difficult to differentiate from the nucleus of a vaginal epithelial cell.</p>

    <p>Culture of <em>Trichomonas vaginalis</em>, which has a higher sensitivity than the wet mount microscopic examination, was the cornerstone for detecting this organism before the advent of point-of-care antigen tests and nucleic acid amplification tests. Although a culture medium is commercially available, cultures of samples from women with trichomoniasis are usually positive in the first 3 days of inoculation, but they have to be incubated for up to 7 days to rule out infection. Routine culture methods detecting <em>Trichomonas vaginalis</em> are no longer widely performed.</p>

    <p>Additional tests for other STIs that could be considered when trichomoniasis is confirmed or suspected are shown in Table 22.2.</p>

    <p class="noindent">No effective vaccine against <em>Trichomonas vaginalis</em> is available. Prevention of infection is therefore a key strategy. Important elements of prevention include counselling and behavioural approaches including comprehensive sexuality education, pre- and post-test counselling, safe sex and risk reduction counselling, and promoting consistent use of condoms. Interventions targeting high-risk groups (e.g. men who have sex with men, transgender people, sex workers and people who inject drugs) may be considered. Offering HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis to people at high risk of HIV infection may be considered.</p>

    <p>Sexual partners should always be informed of the infection and treated <em>(189)</em>. Reporting of this infection to health authorities according to local regulations should also be done.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Definition</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Lower UTIs are acute infections in which only the lower part of the urinary tract is affected, such as the bladder (e.g. cystitis). These infections are often classified as either complicated or uncomplicated based on the presence of risk factors that make them more difficult to treat.</p>

    <p>Complications can occur with lower UTIs because of certain patient-related risk factors. While there is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes a complicated UTI, lower UTIs in individuals with certain conditions of the urinary tract (e.g. anatomical anomalies and kidney stones) are generally complicated. Infections in pregnant women are also usually included in this category. Examples of factors that may increase the risk of a complicated lower UTI are shown in Box 23.1 but should not be considered a complete list.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_284" title="284" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Lower UTIs occur when pathogens (usually ascending the urethra from the perineal area) reach the bladder and overcome the host defences, which leads to parenchymal damage and an inflammatory response. Microorganisms in the urine do not inevitably lead to infection. Infection will depend on the interaction between the organism (for example, because of virulence factors of the pathogen), the patient (who may have more infections because of underlying diseases) and the environment (for example, the presence of a urinary catheter).</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Epidemiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Lower UTIs are very common worldwide and can affect people of any age. According to the Global Burden of Disease study, in 2017 there were an estimated 274 million new cases of UTIs (lower and upper) globally, combining all ages and both sexes <em>(44)</em>.</p>

    <p>The incidence of UTIs is highest in women and increases with age (e.g. UTIs increase after menopause) and frequency of sexual activity. These infections are particularly common in women because of the anatomy of their lower urinary tract; women have a shorter urethra than men and so microorganisms colonizing the skin of the perineal area can more easily reach the bladder. However, after 65 years of age, rates of lower UTIs in men and women tend to be more similar <em>(223)</em>. It is estimated that more than 50% of women experience at least one episode of lower UTI in their lifetime. After a first episode, the risk of recurrence in young women has been estimated to be about 70% within a year <em>(224)</em>. Risk factors for UTIs include anatomical and functional abnormalities of the urinary tract, for example, conditions that predispose to incomplete emptying of the bladder, renal insufficiency and urinary incontinence. Defective host immune factors (e.g. poorly controlled diabetes or neutropenia) and instrumentation of the urinary tract (e.g. urinary catheters and stents) are also predisposing factors.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Most likely pathogens</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Lower UTIs are usually caused by bacteria that are part of the human intestinal microbiota, most frequently <em>Escherichia coli</em>. In clinical practice a causative pathogen is usually only identified in more severe cases when urinary cultures are obtained. Pathogens that most frequently cause UTIs are shown in Table 23.1. Data on causative organisms from low- and middle-income countries are limited; however, if a difference exists in the proportion of less common pathogens, it is unlikely to affect management. In Africa and the Middle East <em>Schistosoma haematobium</em> can present with haematuria and signs of a UTI, particularly in children.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Clinical presentation</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Classical symptoms of lower UTIs include a combination of acute (&lt; 1 week) dysuria, increased urinary urgency and frequency, lower abdominal pain or discomfort, and sometimes gross haematuria, that is, blood can be seen in the urine. In women, vaginal discharge or irritation should be excluded before concluding a diagnosis of lower UTI. In elderly patients with pre-existing urinary symptoms (e.g. urinary incontinence), the evaluation may be more difficult. However, the most reliable symptoms in these cases are still acute urinary changes compared with the baseline. Atypical symptoms, such as falls and altered mental status, are unreliable. In addition, cloudy urine and smelly urine alone are not reliable signs of a UTI.</p>

    <p>In children, symptoms can include vomiting, low-grade fever, increased urgency and frequency, dysuria, new incontinence, smelly urine, or lower abdominal pain and discomfort.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Laboratory tests</strong></h2>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Patient microbiology tests</h3>

    <p class="noindent">In symptomatic patients at a higher risk of complications and in children, a urine culture may be performed (Table 23.2). The rationale is to confirm the diagnosis and to adjust empiric treatment based on susceptibility results.</p>

    <p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_286" title="286" role="doc-pagebreak"/>In children, a clean catch specimen is difficult to obtain but is preferred to a specimen obtained with a urine collection bag. Positive urine cultures in patients without symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria) are frequent and not indicative of bacterial cystitis. Except for very select cases (for example, pregnant women, or before invasive urological interventions), asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated with antibiotics.</p>

In a symptomatic patient, leukocyturia (&gt; 10 leukocytes/μL, 0.01 x 10<sup>9</sup> /L), the presence of leukocyte esterase and/or positive nitrites are indirect signs of infection.

    <p class="noindent">Empiric treatment would ideally be guided by recent clinically relevant local microbiology surveillance data, however these data are not routinely available. This would include clinical microbiology surveys of urine culture data from patients with lower UTI in the primary care/community setting, not hospital outpatient clinic data which likely over-estimate the prevalence of resistance. These surveys would ideally include information on the current and previous recent antibiotic treatment, clinical disease severity, patient risk factors and clinical outcomes. The focus would be on significant urine bacterial isolates resistant to antibiotics recommended in the EML and EMLc, such as nitrofurantoin.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Imaging</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Initial imaging (e.g. ultrasound) of the urinary tract is not needed to diagnose a lower UTI. Imaging to investigate possible underlying abnormalities of the urinary tract could be considered, mostly in children and male patients.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>No antibiotic care</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Analgesic treatment should be complementary to antibiotic treatment to relieve pain associated with lower UTIs (Table 23.4). In young women who are not pregnant, clinically well, with a mild infection and who may wish to avoid or delay antibiotic treatment, symptomatic treatment alone (with a back-up antibiotic prescription) could be considered.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Antibiotic treatment is usually given empirically if there are compatible signs and symptoms of a UTI <strong>AND</strong> a positive test (urinalysis or urine culture). If diagnostic tests cannot be performed, treatment may be given based on clinical presentation alone. If a urine culture is performed, empiric treatment should be reassessed once the results of susceptibility testing are available.</p>

    <p>Clinical improvement should be within 48–72 hours of starting treatment. In general, antibiotics shorten the duration of symptoms by about 2 days <em>(225)</em>. Efforts to reduce patient self-medication with antibiotics should be made as self-medication is still very common in some settings <em>(226)</em>.</p>

    <p>Local patterns of AMR, mostly to <em>Escherichia coli</em>, should be considered when available but interpreted with caution. In most cases, the summary prevalence of resistance reported by hospital microbiology laboratories will probably not be representative of first infections in the primary health care setting and may overestimate the true prevalence of resistance for lower UTIs because of selection bias. Most urine cultures are done on patients who have relapsed after their first empiric treatment and are being re-treated or have underlying reason for a higher risk of resistant infections. Most lower UTIs in patients who are not at risk of complications are still caused by pathogens that are susceptible to commonly used antibiotics. However, patterns of resistance based on good quality local data when available and on individual risk factors (e.g. previous urine culture results and recent antibiotic exposure) should be considered <em>(227–229)</em>. In particular, <em>Escherichia coli</em> may have varying levels of resistance to first-choice antibiotics <em>(230)</em> and resistance is associated with higher rates of clinical failure <em>(15)</em>.</p>

    <p>Nitrofurantoin for 5 days is the main antibiotic recommended for acute cystitis. However, the paediatric formulation (syrup) may not be widely available and is currently expensive, even in high-income settings. Nitrofurantoin still has activity against most isolates producing ESBL <em>(231)</em>.</p>

    <p>Different empiric antibiotic options for treating lower UTIs are shown in Table 23.5.</p>

    <p>Treatment duration is influenced by the antibiotic used, the age and sex of the patient, and for women by the presence of pregnancy.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Definition</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">In some patients with infection, a dysregulated host immune response to the infection contributes to the severity of the disease and organ dysfunction. These patients are at increased risk of death and severe sequelae and should be identified and treated rapidly. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_296" title="296" role="doc-pagebreak"/>The definition of sepsis has remained a challenge because sepsis is not a single entity (the pathogens and primary sites of infection causing sepsis, for example, vary widely) but a continuum of many different clinical presentations.</p>

    <p>Because of the serious clinical consequences of sepsis (see section on epidemiology), many attempts have been made to provide clinicians with simple and easy-to-use criteria for identifying patients with sepsis.</p>

    <div class="box_amarelo">
      <p class="box_tit"><img src="../Images/notes_icon.jpg" alt="Imagem"/> <strong>Note</strong></p>

      <p class="box_p">Sepsis in adults was last defined in 2016 by the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock, known as SEPSIS-3 <em>(237)</em>. According to this definition, sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Compared with previous definitions (SEPSIS-1 in 1991 and SEPSIS 2 in 2001), SEPSIS-3 removed the criteria for “systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)” from the definition because the criteria lacked specificity. SIRS referred to an exaggerated inflammatory response of the body to a noxious cause characterized by a combination of symptoms such as fever or hypothermia, increased heart and/or respiratory rate and increased white blood cell count. SEPSIS-3 also dropped the term severe sepsis because the concept of non-severe sepsis was not helpful – all sepsis is a severe disease – and could be misleading and divert attention from providing rapid and effective treatment. Instead, SEPSIS-3 differentiates only between sepsis and septic shock. Septic shock is defined as a type of sepsis in which underlying circulatory and cellular and/or metabolic abnormalities are severe enough to substantially increase mortality. Patients with septic shock have persistent hypotension that requires vasopressor medication to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mmHg or more and a level of serum lactate more than 2 mmol/L (&gt; 18 mg/dL) in the absence of hypovolaemia <em>(238)</em>.</p>

    <p>It should be noted that the definition of sepsis does not include the detection of bacteria in blood cultures (i.e. bacteraemia). See Box 24.1 for terms and definitions related to bloodstream infections.</p>

    <div class="box_azul">
      <p class="box_tit"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_297" title="297" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong><a id="Box24.1"/>Box 24.1 – Bacteraemia</strong></p>

      <p class="box_p">Bacteraemia (i.e. the detection of bacteria in blood cultures) is not part of the definition of sepsis. While many patients with sepsis have bacteraemia, this is not a universal finding and most patients with bacteraemia do not meet sepsis criteria. The term septicaemia should be avoided. The terms bacteraemia and bloodstream infection, are often used interchangeably. However bloodstream infections can also be caused by pathogens other than bacteria (e.g. fungi).</p>

      <p class="box_p">The Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS) uses the following definition of suspected bloodstream infection <em>(239)</em>:</p>

      <p class="box_p">Presence of two or more of the following clinical signs in an adult patient:</p>

      <ul>
        <li class="box_li">Hyperthermia (&gt; 38.0 °C) or hypothermia (&lt; 36.0 °C)</li>

        <li class="box_li">Respiratory rate ≥ 20 breaths/minute</li>

        <li class="box_li">Heart rate &gt; 90 beats/minute.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="box_p">A confirmed bloodstream infection requires the isolation of a clinically relevant pathogen from a blood sample of a patient (all ages) seeking health care at a health care facility.</p>
    </div>

    <p>The criteria to identify sepsis according to SEPSIS-3 are difficult to apply in low- and middle-income countries because severity is based on criteria and tests that may not be routinely available in these settings, for example, the use of inotropes, and determination of arterial oxygen partial pressure, bilirubin levels, creatinine concentrations and platelet counts. Furthermore, the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (see Table 24.1) has been validated mostly in high-income settings. Its performance in low- and middle-income countries, where causes of sepsis rarely encountered in most high-income settings (e.g. dengue and malaria) are frequent and HIV infection is more prevalent, is unclear.</p>

    <p>To implement the SEPSIS-3 definition, clinical and laboratory signs are graded to give an overall SOFA score, and an acute change of two or more points in the baseline score is proposed to identify organ dysfunction due to infection and predict the short-term mortality risk <em>(237)</em>.</p>

    <p>The SOFA score (range 0–24) includes six parameters – two clinical and four laboratory ones. Each parameter can have a value from 0 to 4 (Table 24.1). The baseline SOFA score can be assumed to be zero in patients with no known pre-existing organ dysfunction.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_304" title="304" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Sepsis is a serious and complex clinical condition caused by a complicated interplay between an infectious agent and a dysregulated systemic immunological response by the patient, which could potentially result in multiple organ dysfunction and possibly death. Risk factors for sepsis mostly overlap with those that predispose patients to infection, for example, being very old or very young, immunosuppression due to HIV infection, cancer, on medications, cirrhosis, alcohol abuse, poorly controlled diabetes, indwelling catheters and malnutrition. Genetic factors are also implicated in the likelihood of developing sepsis in patients with an infection <em>(242)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Epidemiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Sepsis is an important global health problem that can be difficult to diagnose and manage, especially in low-income settings <em>(234,243)</em>. According to the Global Burden of Disease study, about 49 million new cases of sepsis occurred worldwide in 2017, a decrease of almost 19% compared with 1990 <em>(244)</em>. The most common underlying cause of sepsis is still diarrhoeal disease – 9 million attributable cases in 2017. Since 2017, the number of sepsis-related deaths has decreased worldwide (a 29% decrease compared with 1990) but deaths were still high (11 million in 2017) with the highest burden in sub-Saharan Africa. The most common underlying cause of sepsis-related death was lower respiratory tract infections, 1.8 million attributable deaths in 2017. Children were more affected by sepsis than adults; in 2017, 20 million new cases of sepsis were in children &lt; 5 years of age (see the chapter on sepsis in children and neonates). However, a second peak in incidence in older adults was reported. About one in four cases of sepsis is estimated to be hospital-acquired with high mortality rates <em>(245)</em>.</p>

    <p>Sepsis can also develop during pregnancy or in the first weeks after delivery. This form of sepsis is called maternal sepsis. In 2017, about 12 million new cases of maternal sepsis were reported <em>(244)</em>. In the period 2003–2009, sepsis was the third leading cause of maternal death worldwide (10.7% of all maternal deaths or about 260 000 deaths) after haemorrhage and hypertensive disorders <em>(246)</em>. Based on results of the global maternal sepsis study of more than 700 facilities in 52 countries, 70 pregnant women per 1000 live births in the study cohort were hospitalized with an infection, mostly of bacterial origin – 77% of those where a pathogen was identified <em>(247)</em>. Infections with severe maternal outcomes (e.g. death) were frequent (11 per 1000 live births); however, large variations existed across countries – 15 per 1000 live births in low- and middle-income countries and 0.6 per 1000 in high-income countries. Infections originated most often from the genital (endometritis and chorioamnionitis) or urinary tract followed by skin, respiratory and abortion-related infections <em>(247)</em>.</p>

    <p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_305" title="305" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria are an increasingly important cause of sepsis worldwide with important implications for the management, especially in settings with limited resources. Antibiotic resistance can affect patient outcomes, increasing short-term mortality, mostly because in these cases effective antibiotic treatment active against the resistant pathogen may not be available or given late. In a 2015 European study, 170 DALYs per 100 000 population were due to infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, of which about 70% were caused by bloodstream infections <em>(248)</em>.</p>

    <p>In 2017, the World Health Assembly adopted a resolution on sepsis to urge WHO Member States to implement measures to reduce the burden of sepsis by increasing efforts to improve sepsis prevention, diagnosis and treatment, including through increased research, training of health care professionals and public awareness campaigns <em>(234,249)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Most likely pathogens</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Sepsis can originate from any type of infection (bacterial, viral, fungal and protozoal) in any organ system. Infections can be community-acquired or hospital-acquired (or health care-associated). The bacterial pathogens associated with sepsis will vary widely depending on the primary site of infection, geography and place of acquisition (community or hospital, see Table 24.3).</p>

    <p>Pathogens other than bacteria should be considered according to the local epidemiology. For example, certain settings are endemic for <em>Plasmodium</em> spp., the pathogen causing malaria, and this should always be considered where appropriate, including after travel to endemic areas. Many other pathogens, including viruses causing viral haemorrhagic fevers or respiratory viruses such as the influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 and fungal infections, also need to be considered where appropriate (community- and hospital-acquired infections).</p>

    <p>The mortality from sepsis is higher with infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria, which are commonly identified in hospital-acquired infections.</p>

      <p class="box_tit"><img src="../Images/notes_icon.jpg" alt="Imagem"/> <strong>Note</strong></p>

      <p class="box_p">Presenting symptoms and signs and the clinical course of sepsis are highly variable and depend on the underlying pathogen, the main organ affected and the host response. Early recognition and treatment of sepsis is essential and can affect mortality. Therefore, signs of severe infection and organ dysfunction should be identified promptly.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="noindent">Patients with sepsis usually present with non-specific signs and symptoms. The most frequent symptoms include fever (≥ 38.0 °C) or hypothermia (&lt; 36.0 °C), some degree of respiratory distress (e.g. increased respiratory rate), tachycardia, acute altered mental status (e.g. disorientation and agitation) and hypotension. Oliguria (i.e. reduced urine output) may also be present.</p>

    <p>Sepsis may be more difficult to diagnose in countries where vector-transmitted diseases (e.g. malaria and dengue) are endemic; therefore, sepsis should always be considered if there are any signs and symptoms of sepsis in these settings.</p>

    <p>As outlined earlier, bacteraemia (i.e. the detection of bacteria in blood cultures) may be present depending on the type of pathogen, the primary site of infection and whether antibiotic treatment was administered before obtaining blood cultures. However, bacteraemia is not always found in patients with sepsis and most patients with bacteraemia do not have sepsis.</p>

    <div class="box_amarelo">
      <p class="box_tit"><img src="../Images/notes_icon.jpg" alt="Imagem"/> <strong>Note</strong></p>

      <p class="box_p">Accurate identification of patients with sepsis is difficult and no single gold standard test exists. Therefore, adoption and use of internationally accepted case definitions (e.g. the SEPSIS-3 definition) is critical to avoid over-diagnosis and overtreatment. Not every patient with an infection has sepsis, in fact, only a very small proportion of patients with infection have sepsis. The term sepsis should therefore be used carefully.</p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Sepsis of unknown origin</strong>. The treatment of this type of sepsis is based on the most probable clinical situation. Patients should be carefully examined to localize a source of infection, including pressure ulcers, deep-seated abscesses and indwelling vascular and urinary catheters. In patients with central lines, the possibility of a central line-associated bloodstream infection should be considered with a positive blood culture and no other apparent source of infection. Bloodstream infections can also be associated with peripheral vascular lines.</p>

      <p class="box_p">Diagnostic tests should be guided by the suspected primary site of infection. Tests, and management, which are outlined in the following paragraphs, will be different for suspected pneumonia, intra-abdominal infection, urinary tract infection, meningitis or sepsis of unknown origin. Please also refer to specific chapters of the AWaRe book based on the suspected underlying infection.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="noindent">Microbiology tests help establish a definitive diagnosis of sepsis and identify the causative pathogen and underlying infection. Isolating a pathogen from a normally sterile body site (e.g. blood, cerebrospinal fluid) that is compatible with the clinical signs and symptoms usually confirms the diagnosis. However, the causative pathogen is not identified in a substantial proportion of cases, especially in patients pretreated with antibiotics.</p>

    <p>Tests to consider when sepsis of bacterial origin is suspected include those listed in Table 24.4. Ideally, these tests should be done before starting antibiotic treatment.</p>

    <p class="noindent">When sepsis is suspected and respiratory distress is present, a chest X-ray (or lung ultrasound) is indicated to confirm a lower respiratory tract infection. If an abdominal source of infection is suspected, in settings where it is available, a CT scan of the abdomen could be considered, for example, to confirm an intra-abdominal infection. A low-dose CT scan is an acceptable option, including in pregnant women <em>(253)</em>. However, because abdominal ultrasound is more widely available, it can be a very helpful alternative depending on the exact site of infection. If sepsis caused by an infection of the urinary tract is suspected, initial imaging (e.g. ultrasound) of the urinary tract or during follow-up could be considered if an outflow obstruction (e.g. because of urolithiasis) or an abscess are suspected. If a dental infection is suspected, then X-rays are recommended, as detailed in the corresponding chapter.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Treatment</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Treatment of sepsis includes treatment of the underlying infection, source control and life-saving interventions such as fluid resuscitation and vital organ support which are beyond the scope of the AWaRe book. For more specific guidance on treating sepsis, please refer to the 2016 international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock <em>(254)</em>. Please also consult a 2016 review on the pathophysiology and clinical management of sepsis <em>(255)</em>.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Antibiotic treatment (if bacterial sepsis is suspected)</h3>

    <div class="box_amarelo">
      <p class="box_tit"><img src="../Images/notes_icon.jpg" alt="Imagem"/> <strong>Note</strong></p>

      <p class="box_p">Intravenous antibiotic treatment should be started as soon as possible when sepsis of bacterial origin is suspected. Taking laboratory and microbiology tests or waiting for the results should not delay administration of the first dose of antibiotic treatment.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_313" title="313" role="doc-pagebreak"/>When selecting empiric antibiotic treatment, several factors should be considered, such as the most likely site of primary infection, the infecting pathogens and the local pattern of AMR. Comorbidities of the patient, including malnutrition and immunosuppression (e.g. due to HIV infection or neutropenia) and other factors, such as known colonization and/or previous infection with multidrug-resistant organisms, are also important factors to consider. Many variables must be considered to provide the best treatment to patients with sepsis.</p>

    <p>Table 24.7 outlines suggested empiric treatment regimens for common primary sites of infection. In many infections (e.g. necrotizing fasciitis and intra-abdominal infections), source control (e.g. drainage of an abscess, surgical debridement) is essential.</p>

    <p>If the pathogen causing the infection is identified and once its antibiotic susceptibilities are known, antibiotics should be reviewed and modified accordingly. However, even if enough suitable samples have been obtained and tested, a pathogen is identified only in a minority of patients with sepsis <em>(256)</em>. When no pathogen is identified, antibiotic treatment should be guided by available laboratory results and clinical response. If an alternative cause of a non-bacterial cause of sepsis has been identified, the possibility to stop treatment should be evaluated.</p>

    <p>Treatment duration is often decided on an individual basis according to clinical response and, if available, changes in laboratory markers of infection.</p>

    <p><strong>Simplify</strong> empiric treatment to a more narrow-spectrum antibiotic (often also called de-escalation) based on culture results (targeted treatment) or based on rapid clinical improvement when no microbiology test results are available. In general, the intravenous route is preferred for the initial phase of treatment.</p>

    <p><strong>Step-down</strong> to oral treatment is based on improvement of symptoms, signs of infection and the ability to take oral antibiotics allowing discharge of the patient home when clinically appropriate.</p>

    <p>In patients with suspected sepsis of bacterial origin, a risk assessment based on clinical factors needs to be done, followed by appropriate tests and investigations to choose the best empiric antibiotic treatment. Patient-level and setting-level risk factors for infections caused by resistant bacteria need to be carefully considered.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Low-risk patients</strong>: patients with no clinical risk factors for adverse outcomes. These patients have a low risk of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.</li>

      <li><strong>High-risk patients</strong>: patients with major pre-existing comorbidities or immunocompromised and/or previous colonization or infection with a resistant pathogen. These patients have a higher risk of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="noindent">Because of differences in the microbiology, sepsis in children is often classified as neonatal sepsis (newborns &lt; 28 days) and paediatric sepsis (28 days–12 years).</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Neonatal sepsis</h3>

    <p class="noindent">There is no universally accepted definition of neonatal sepsis and definitions vary among studies <em>(258)</em>. However, the term is used to describe a serious systemic condition of infectious origin (most commonly bacterial) associated with a combination of clinical and laboratory signs that occurs in the first month of life.</p>

    <p>Neonates are much more likely to have a primary bloodstream infection with no underlying source of infection identified. Furthermore, because of differences in the host (neonates have reduced immune responses) and the way the pathogen can be acquired (e.g. exposure to maternal pathogens at birth or in utero), the sepsis definitions currently used for adults and older children are not specifically designed for use in young infants <em>(259,260)</em>.</p>

    <p>Neonatal sepsis has historically been categorized based on either the timing of clinical disease onset (early-onset sepsis or late-onset sepsis) or based on where the infection was likely acquired (community-acquired infection or hospital-acquired infection) (Box 25.1). The aim of these categorizations is to predict the most likely causative pathogens and guide empiric treatment. However, these categorizations have become less helpful as more infants worldwide are born in health care facilities and are exposed to multidrug-resistant pathogens in the early neonatal period, either acquired from their mother or through nosocomial acquisition in the health facility or hospital.</p>

    <div class="box_azul1">
      <p class="box_tit"><strong><a id="Box25.1"/>Box 25.1 – Commonly used categorizations of neonatal sepsis</strong></p>

      <p class="box_p1"><strong>By timing of onset</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li class="box_li">early onset<sup>a</sup> (occurring ≤ 3 days after birth, often acquired vertically from the mother or in the peripartum period)</li>

        <li class="box_li">late onset (occurring &gt; 3 days after birth, often hospital acquired)</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="box_p1"><strong>By setting of acquisition</strong></p>

      </ul>
    </div>

    <p class="legenda"><sup>a</sup> A range of different postnatal ages have been used to define early onset sepsis, including less than 3, 5 or 7 days of life.</p>

    <p class="space"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_321" title="321" role="doc-pagebreak"/>In settings with limited access to any laboratory tests, an alternative clinical definition used by the WHO is: possible serious bacterial infection <em>(261,262)</em>. This definition is based on the presence of multiple clinical signs (Box 25.2). If at least one of the signs is present, the neonate or young infant requires prompt treatment with antibiotics. Relevant signs to consider include difficulty feeding, history of convulsions, movement only when stimulated, respiratory rate &gt; 60 breaths/minute, severe chest retractions and temperature ≥ 38.0 °C or &lt; 35.5 °C.</p>

    <div class="box_azul">
      <p class="box_tit"><strong><a id="Box25.2"/>Box 25.2 – Definition of possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI)</strong></p>

      <p class="box_p">A young infant is classified as having PSBI when any one or more of the following signs is present:</p>

      <ul>
        <li class="box_li">Not able to feed since birth or stopped feeding well (confirmed by observation)</li>

        <li class="box_li">No movement or movement only on stimulation</li>

        <li class="box_li">Convulsions</li>

        <li class="box_li">Fast breathing (60 breaths per minute or more) in infants younger than 7 days of age</li>

        <li class="box_li">Severe chest in-drawing</li>

        <li class="box_li">Fever (≥ 38.0 °C)</li>

        <li class="box_li">Low body temperature (&lt; 35.5 °C)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>Clinical signs and symptoms are important predictors of neonatal sepsis, as well as perinatal risk factors, such as prematurity/gestational age. Several scores exist that measure severity of sepsis and help predict short-term mortality, but these are almost all derived in the high-income setting. Scores are used to promptly identify neonates who would benefit the most from optimal antibiotic treatment and supportive care.</p>

    <p>Because of its simplicity, one of the most frequently used scores is the Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology–II (SNAP-II score) <em>(263)</em>. This score was developed in 2001 to predict outcomes (usually short-term mortality) in cases of possible neonatal sepsis. It should be noted, however, that this score has not been extensively validated in low- and middle-income countries and therefore there is no clear consensus on its use. Some evidence exists from low- and middle-income country settings that SNAP-II scores differ significantly in neonates with sepsis who survive or die in the short-term irrespective of gestational age <em>(264)</em>. The SNAPPE-II score is an extension of the SNAP-II score which includes additional perinatal parameters <em>(263)</em>.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Sepsis in children beyond neonatal age</h3>

    <p class="noindent">The definition of possible serious bacterial infection outlined in the previous section on neonatal sepsis can also be used beyond neonatal age to children younger than 5 years.</p>

    <p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_322" title="322" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Other paediatric sepsis definitions in use include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference, 2005 <em>(265)</em>. Suspected or proven infection caused by any pathogen or clinical syndrome associated with a high probability of infection AND systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome is defined as abnormal temperature or abnormal white blood cell count AND one of the following age-adjusted signs: tachycardia or bradycardia, tachypnoea and/or mechanical ventilation <em>(266)</em>.</li>

      <li>Paediatric adaptation of the Sepsis-3 adult sepsis definition, including the paediatric version of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (Table 25.1) <em>(267)</em>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It should be noted that the definition of sepsis does not include the detection of bacteria in blood cultures (i.e. bacteraemia). See Box 25.3 for terms and definitions related to blood stream infections.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_332" title="332" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Sepsis is an acute life-threatening condition characterized by organ dysfunction/s due to a dysregulated host response to infection and to the direct effect of the pathogen <em>(268)</em>.</p>

    <p>A combination of factors contributes to the clinical manifestation and severity of sepsis. Severity of sepsis depends on a combination of the amount and virulence of the pathogen and the immune status of the host, for example, immunological immaturity or dysfunction in preterm neonates, severe malnutrition and HIV infection. In addition, the timing of exposure to the pathogen plays an important role in neonates. In this age group, early-onset sepsis is usually associated with in utero infections (e.g. chorioamnionitis) or infections caused by pathogens that colonize the maternal genital tract and that can be acquired during delivery. Late-onset sepsis is more commonly associated with postnatal acquisition of community- or health care-associated pathogens.</p>

    <p>Sepsis in neonates has a non-specific clinical presentation and many neonates with suspected sepsis who receive antibiotics do not have sepsis and do not have any significant infection. This should be considered when sepsis is suspected to avoid over-diagnosis and overtreatment.</p>

    <p>Beyond the neonatal age, sepsis in children can also be a primary bacterial bloodstream infection (e.g. meningococcal or pneumococcal sepsis), most commonly community-acquired. Sepsis in children may also be the result of an underlying infection in a particular site (e.g. pyelonephritis, intra-abdominal infection or meningitis) or a health care-acquired infection.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Epidemiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">In 2015, about 6 million children younger than 5 years were estimated to have died, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia <em>(122)</em>. Neonates account for about half of the deaths in this age group. Overall, about 2.7 million neonates died in 2015 and of these, about 400 000 were estimated to be the result of sepsis or meningitis, and 517 000 children younger than 5 years died from sepsis or meningitis. Sepsis is the third leading cause of death in neonates after prematurity and birth asphyxia, both of which are associated with maternal infections such as chorioamnionitis <em>(122)</em>. Premature birth (&lt; 37 weeks of gestation) and low birth weight are the main risk factors for neonatal sepsis and are associated with higher mortality. In early onset sepsis, additional risk factors are: intra-amniotic infections (i.e. chorioamnionitis); prolonged rupture of the membranes (&gt; 18 hours); and maternal rectovaginal colonization with specific pathogens, such as group B streptococci (<em>Streptococcus agalactiae</em>). Neonates with underlying disease such as congenital malformations, or those undergoing invasive procedures, or those with central or peripheral catheters, or those undergoing surgical procedures or those with prolonged hospital stays are also at increased risk of sepsis.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_333" title="333" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Most likely pathogens</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Sepsis can be caused by a variety of pathogens including fungi and viruses, although it is most commonly caused by bacteria <em>(268)</em>. Differences in causative pathogens may be present based on the age of the child, presence or absence of underlying comorbidities and type of comorbidity, and geographical location, such as children in high-income versus low- and middle-income settings. Pathogens most frequently associated with sepsis in neonates 28 days or younger are shown in Table 25.2. Pathogens most frequently associated with sepsis in children beyond the neonatal age are shown in Table 25.3.</p>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Patient microbiology tests</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Microbiology tests help establish a definitive diagnosis of sepsis and identify the causative pathogen and underlying infection. Isolating a pathogen from a normally sterile body site (e.g. blood, cerebrospinal fluid) that is compatible with the clinical signs and symptoms usually confirms diagnosis. A septic screen in young infants would normally include culture of blood, urine and cerebrospinal fluid, and a chest X-ray may be considered.</p>

    <p>Diagnostic tests should be guided by the suspected primary site of infection and will be different for pneumonia, meningitis or sepsis of unknown origin. Please also refer to specific chapters of the AWaRe book based on the suspected underlying infection.</p>

    <p>Tests to consider when sepsis of bacterial origin is suspected are indicated in Table 25.4. Ideally, these tests should be done before starting antibiotic treatment, but treatment should not be delayed in a very unwell child.</p>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Using microbiology surveillance data</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Targeted clinical microbiology surveys of neonates and children with confirmed sepsis, including clinical presentation and infection focus, underlying disease, bloodstream isolate and resistance phenotype, antibiotic treatment and clinical outcome, may be helpful at a local and national level to inform empiric guidance.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Imaging</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">If available, imaging studies should be guided by the suspected primary site of infection as for microbiological sampling. Please also refer to specific chapters of the AWaRe book based on the suspected underlying infection. When sepsis is suspected and respiratory distress is present, a chest X-ray is indicated to confirm a lower respiratory tract infection that may not always be clinically obvious.</p>

    <p>If an abdominal source of infection is suspected, an abdominal ultrasound could be considered. As an alternative and if available, a CT scan of the abdomen could also be considered; however, limiting exposure to radiation should always be considered, especially in young children. If sepsis caused by an infection of the urinary tract is suspected, initial imaging (e.g. ultrasound) of the urinary tract or during follow-up could be considered if an outflow obstruction or collection are suspected.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Antibiotic treatment</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Antibiotic treatment should be started as soon as possible when sepsis is suspected. Performance and results of laboratory and microbiology tests should not delay the first dose of antibiotic treatment.</p>

    <p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_341" title="341" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Even though the presence of perinatal risk factors (prematurity, prolonged rupture of membranes) often leads to early empiric antibiotic use in babies, there is good evidence that these risk factors alone do not reliably predict neonatal sepsis. Therefore, antibiotic treatment should generally be started in newborn infants based on a combination of clinical and laboratory signs. In neonates with significant risk factors for infection – for example, membranes ruptured &gt; 18 hours before delivery, mother had fever ≥ 38.0 °C before delivery or during labour, or amniotic fluid was foul smelling or purulent – prophylactic antibiotics (ampicillin and gentamicin) should be given for only 2 days. The neonate should be reassessed after 2 days and treatment continued only if there are signs of sepsis or a positive blood culture <em>(261)</em>.</p>

    <p>Empiric treatment (see Table 25.7) should always cover the most probable causative pathogens, namely:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>in neonates: Gram-negative bacteria, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, Group B <em>Streptococcus</em>;</li>

      <li>in children beyond the neonatal age: Gram-negative bacteria, <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Simplify</strong> empiric treatment to a more narrow-spectrum antibiotic (often also called de-escalation) based on culture results if a pathogen is isolated (targeted treatment). When no organism is identified, antibiotic treatment should be guided by available laboratory results and clinical response. Simplification of empiric antibiotic regimens for low-risk neonates, using two doses of parenteral gentamicin combined with oral amoxicillin, is being implemented in primary health care settings.</p>

    <p>In malaria-endemic areas, in a child with shock or severe illness and decreased alertness, it is often difficult to differentiate between severe <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em> malaria and invasive bacterial infection (often caused by invasive non-typhoidal <em>Salmonella</em>), and co-infections are not uncommon. In all such cases, empiric parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotics should be started immediately, together with antimalarial treatment <em>(273)</em>.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Meningitis is an acute inflammation of the meninges, the membranes lining the brain and spinal cord. It can be infectious or non-infectious in origin (e.g. associated with autoimmune disease) and can be associated with high morbidity and mortality, even if treated promptly.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_350" title="350" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">The pathogens that cause meningitis can colonize the upper respiratory tract and from there invade the bloodstream and get access to the central nervous system through the ventricular choroid plexus or can access the meninges by local spread. Because the central nervous system lacks effective immune defences, organisms can multiply rapidly, cause direct tissue injury to the meninges and produce an inflammatory response that contributes to neurological symptoms.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Epidemiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Meningitis is found worldwide and can affect individuals of all ages, although some differences exist across geographic regions. Mortality is highest in children younger than 5 years. Outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis mostly occurring during cooler and drier seasons are a serious threat, especially in the so-called meningitis belt, an area in the peri-Sahelian African region stretching from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east. Although deaths from meningitis decreased overall by about 20% between 1990 and 2016 (from an estimated 403 000 deaths to about 318 000 a year), the burden of bacterial meningitis is still high, especially in low- and middle-income countries despite an increase in immunization programmes <em>(278)</em>. According to data from the Global Burden of Disease study, in 2017, there were around 5 million new cases of meningitis (considering all ages and both sexes combined) <em>(44)</em>. Almost half of the cases were of viral origin (2.4 million cases). In the same year, the number of new cases of acute pneumococcal (about 440 000) and meningococcal (about 400 000) meningitis were similar, while <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> accounted for an estimated 262 000 new cases <em>(44)</em>.</p>

    <p>Tuberculous meningitis is more common in settings with a high prevalence of TB, especially among patients living with HIV. In settings where TB is endemic, children and young adults are more at risk of TB meningitis (dissemination of primary infection from the lungs to the central nervous system), while in setting with a low prevalence of TB, adults are most at risk (reactivation of a latent TB infection) <em>(279)</em>.</p>

    <p>The incidence and mortality of meningitis are higher in countries with limited resources. In 2016, &gt; 90% of new cases of meningitis and &gt; 80% of deaths (about 270 000 deaths) occurred in countries with a low to middle socioeconomic index, as defined by the Global Burden of Disease study group <em>(278)</em>. In 2016, the highest mortality was reported for central and western sub-Saharan African regions, about 110 000 deaths. Nevertheless, of the 10 countries with the highest absolute number of meningitis deaths in 2016, four were located outside of the meningitis belt (Afghanistan, China, India and Pakistan). About 7% of new meningitis cases and 4% of deaths in 2016 occurred in countries with a high or middle-to-high socioeconomic index <em>(278)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_351" title="351" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Most likely pathogens</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Viral meningitis (usually benign and mainly caused by enteroviruses and arboviruses) and non-infectious causes (e.g. autoimmune or neoplastic diseases or as a side-effect of certain medicines) can mimic the signs and symptoms of bacterial meningitis. Therefore, it is important to consider these causes in the differential diagnosis. The most frequently implicated bacteria (beyond the neonatal age) are <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em> and <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> (serotype b and non-typeable strains). The most likely causative bacteria may differ across age groups (e.g. meningitis due to <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> mainly affects children) and in patients with immune system deficiencies, for example, increased risk of <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em>, increased risk of meningitis caused by encapsulated bacteria such as <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em> and <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> in patients with asplenia or hyposplenia (Table 26.1).</p>

    <p>Tuberculous meningitis should also be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients living in or coming from areas where TB is endemic, especially if the onset of disease is not acute.</p>

    <p>In patients with severe immunosuppression (e.g. with advanced HIV disease), cryptococcal meningitis and cerebral toxoplasmosis should also be considered, although the clinical presentation of these two infections is usually less acute than bacterial meningitis. In patients living in or visiting areas where malaria is endemic, cerebral malaria should also be included in the differential diagnosis. Although most cases of meningitis are community-acquired, the infection can also be health care-associated (e.g. after neurosurgical interventions and after lumbar puncture). In that case, the most likely pathogens are <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> or aerobic Gram-negative bacilli, including multidrug-resistant strains. For prevention of health care-associated meningitis refer to the WHO global guidance on prevention of surgical site infections <em>(280)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_353" title="353" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Meningitis caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Data on the proportion of penicillin- and third-generation cephalosporin-resistant <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> isolates causing meningitis are scarce in most countries with a high incidence of bacterial meningitis; however, whenever available, these data should guide empiric antibiotic treatment. Currently, because of the potential risk of penicillin-resistance in <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> isolates and because meningitis is a very serious and potentially fatal disease, a third-generation cephalosporin is recommended for empiric treatment. Isolates with intermediate or complete resistance to ceftriaxone have rarely been described (mainly in patients with prolonged or multiple exposures to beta-lactam antibiotics in the previous 3 months) and some experts suggest adding intravenous vancomycin or rifampicin empirically to provide effective treatment for these isolates. Meningitis caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria has also been reported.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Clinical presentation</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">In adults, meningitis should be suspected in the case of acute onset (&lt; 48 hours) of:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>fever (≥ 38.0 °C) <strong>AND/OR</strong></li>

      <li>headache and/or change in mental status and/or confusion <strong>AND/OR</strong></li>

      <li>neck stiffness.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Clinical factors to consider in diagnosing meningitis are shown in Box 26.1.</p>

    <div class="box_azul">
      <p class="box_tit"><strong><a id="Box26.1"/>Box 26.1 – Clinical considerations</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li class="box_li">All three of the classic signs and symptoms (fever, confusion and/or headache, and neck stiffness) are present in only around half of patients with bacterial meningitis.</li>

        <li class="box_li">However, 95% of adult patients usually have at least two of these symptoms and the absence of all three symptoms significantly reduces the probability of meningitis <em>(281)</em>.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>A haemorrhagic rash may also be present, especially in cases of meningitis caused by <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em> although such a rash is not specific for meningococcal infection. Notably with <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, foci of infection outside the central nervous system, such as otitis media, sinusitis, pneumonia and endocarditis, are also often observed.</p>

    <p>Because bacterial meningitis is a serious illness and clinical and epidemiological features alone cannot always reliably differentiate bacterial and viral origin, all severe cases <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_354" title="354" role="doc-pagebreak"/>should be treated as if they were bacterial until this has been excluded or a viral cause has been clearly identified.</p>

    <p>For the diagnosis of meningitis in children and neonates, refer to the latest edition of the <em>WHO Pocket book of hospital care for children (31)</em>. In neonates, the clinical presentation is less typical and symptoms are usually non-specific. Neonates often present with a combination of fever, poor feeding, lethargy, drowsiness, vomiting, irritability, seizures or a full fontanelle. Neck stiffness is very uncommon.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Laboratory tests</strong></h2>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Patient microbiology tests</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Whenever possible, certain microbiology tests should be considered (Table 26.2); ideally samples should be obtained before antibiotic treatment is started. The rationale for these tests is to establish the diagnosis and identify the pathogen as this affects treatment.</p>

    <p class="noindent">In the presence of compatible signs and symptoms, a definitive diagnosis of bacterial meningitis requires examination of cerebrospinal fluid. Therefore, whenever possible and if no contraindications are present (such as increased bleeding risk, risk of herniation or a skin infection at the site of the puncture), a lumbar puncture should be done before starting antibiotic treatment. However, doing a lumbar puncture should never delay giving antibiotic treatment when bacterial meningitis is suspected; if available at least blood cultures should be taken before starting treatment. In settings where CT scanning is available, certain patients may benefit from a scan of the head before the lumbar puncture because of the risk of cerebral herniation after removing cerebrospinal fluid at the lumbar level if elevated intracranial pressure is suspected. CT scanning should never delay the start of antibiotic treatment. If available, imaging is indicated in patients with focal neurological signs, decreased level of consciousness or coma or a history of central nervous system disease or recent onset of seizures (&lt; 1 week) or severe immunosuppression (e.g. advanced HIV disease).</p>

    <p>Laboratory tests to consider when meningitis is suspected are given in Table 26.3. In the specific context of epidemics, also consult the WHO meningitis epidemics guidelines <em>(257)</em>.</p>

    <p>In bacterial meningitis, the characteristics of cerebrospinal fluid vary widely (and may be normal or only slightly altered in neonates); however, certain findings suggest a probable bacterial cause. In particular, the following characteristics of the cerebrospinal fluid suggest bacterial meningitis:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>high opening pressure during lumbar puncture (reference range, 80–200 mm H<sub>2</sub>O or 8–20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O)</li>

      <li>turbid appearance of cerebrospinal fluid</li>

      <li>elevated cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count (often more than several hundred to several thousand cells/mm<sup>3</sup> or &gt; 0.1 to &gt; 1 × 10<sup>9</sup> /L)</li>

      <li><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_356" title="356" role="doc-pagebreak"/>elevated cerebrospinal fluid percentage of neutrophils (&gt; 80%)</li>

      <li>elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein (&gt; 45 mg/dL or &gt; 0.45 g/L)</li>

      <li>low cerebrospinal fluid glucose (&lt; 40 mg/dL or &lt; 2.2 mmol/L)</li>

      <li>low cerebrospinal fluid to plasma glucose ratio (≤ 0.4).</li>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Using microbiology surveillance data</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Targeted periodic clinical surveillance, including risk factors, resistance of key pathogens and outcomes, may be helpful to inform empiric guidance at a national level.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_357" title="357" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Tuberculosis meningitis</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">TB meningitis should always be considered in the differential diagnosis in high-risk patients and in settings where TB is endemic. TB meningitis can have an acute presentation and, similar to bacterial meningitis, its diagnosis cannot be made or excluded only on the basis of clinical presentation. Since TB meningitis is a serious disease, prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential <em>(119)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Use of corticosteroids</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">The rationale for the use dexamethasone in cases of meningitis is to reduce the inflammatory response and the risk of neurological sequelae (e.g. hearing loss) and death. The use of adjunctive steroids is suggested only in high-income settings, where it has a proven benefit. Current evidence has failed to show any significant benefit both in terms of mortality and sequelae in patients in low-income countries <em>(283–285)</em>. In high-income countries, dexamethasone can be given before or at the time of the first antibiotic dose if bacterial meningitis is suspected and continued if <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> is confirmed. The recommended dose is 0.15 mg/kg of dexamethasone every 6 hours. Steroids are not recommended in neonatal meningitis.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Antibiotic treatment</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Antibiotic treatment should be started as soon as possible when bacterial meningitis is suspected (Table 26.4). The first dose of antibiotic treatment should not be delayed until the results of the lumbar puncture are available. The choice of empiric antibiotic treatment should take into account the age of the patient, presence of immunosuppression and local prevalence of <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> isolates resistant to third-generation cephalosporins. The patient risk of <em>Listeria</em> meningitis should also be taken into account (e.g. pregnant women, patients who are immunocompromised or patients &gt; 50 years of age) because ceftriaxone (and cefotaxime) do not cover this pathogen and ampicillin should be used in these cases.</p>

    <p>As a general rule, empiric treatment in children other than neonates (&lt; 1 month) and in adults should always cover all three of the main causative pathogens (<em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em> and <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>).</p>

    <p>If a pathogen is isolated and its susceptibilities are known, antibiotics should be reviewed and modified accordingly. When no pathogen is identified, the duration of antibiotic treatment should be guided by available laboratory results and clinical response.</p>

    <p><strong>Step-down</strong> to oral treatment is less commonly used in meningitis management, where the treatment is mainly parenteral where possible to maximize penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Primary prevention of bacterial meningitis relies on vaccination and antibiotic prophylaxis for close contacts of cases. Vaccination is a successful intervention to prevent bacterial meningitis. Available vaccines are active against meningococcal, pneumococcal and <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b disease. Vaccines are never 100% effective and they do not protect against all strains of a bacterial pathogen. Duration of protection is also variable. As a result, even vaccinated people can develop bacterial meningitis.

    <p class="noindent">Appropriate large-scale meningococcal vaccination programmes should be in place in countries with a high (&gt; 10 cases per 100 000 population/year) or intermediate (2–10 cases per 100 000 population/year) incidence of meningococcal disease or with frequent epidemics. In countries in the meningitis belt, all individuals aged 1–29 years (including pregnant women) should be vaccinated with the meningococcal A conjugate vaccine <em>(236,276)</em>.</p>

    <p>In countries with a low incidence of meningococcal disease (&lt; 2 cases per 100 000 population/year), vaccination is recommended only for defined high-risk groups such as children and young adults or individuals with immunodeficiency. The choice of the recommended vaccine depends on the local prevalence of the different meningococcal serogroups <em>(276)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_367" title="367" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Definition</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">CAP is an acute illness affecting the lungs caused by pathogens, most often bacteria and viruses. It usually presents with cough, sputum production (in adults), rapid and difficult breathing with new or worsening pulmonary infiltrate(s) on chest imaging.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">CAP occurs when microbial pathogens (usually inhaled in the upper airways) reach the lower respiratory tract and proliferate in the alveoli. Less frequently, these pathogens can also reach the alveoli via the blood or by direct spread, for example, from an infection of the pleural or intra-abdominal space. Once in the alveoli, host immune defences are activated to eliminate the pathogens. Only when these defences fail, pneumonia manifests itself because of the tissue damage and inflammatory response triggered by the proliferation of microorganisms in the affected lung(s).</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Epidemiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">CAP is common worldwide and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, with an especially high burden in low-income countries <em>(120)</em>. According to the Global Burden of Disease study, in 2017, there were an estimated 471 million new cases of lower respiratory tract infections (including CAP) globally among all ages and sexes combined <em>(44)</em>. However, a majority of these cases were viral bronchitis; therefore, caution is needed in interpreting this number. The incidence of CAP varies with age and a country’s income level. The most common causative pathogen worldwide is <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> and viruses (see the following section); viral–bacterial coinfections may occur.</p>

    <p>In low-income countries, lower respiratory tract infections (including CAP) were the leading cause of death in 2016 with a crude yearly attributable mortality of about 75 per 100 000 population <em>(121)</em>. In general, the incidence of CAP is highest in children younger than 5 years in these countries. In 2015, an estimated 0.9 million children younger than 5 years died of pneumonia and of these, about 0.5 million occurred in sub-Saharan Africa <em>(122)</em>. Undernutrition, HIV infection, and exposure to smoke and air pollution are common risk factors for severe CAP in children younger than 5 years. As a result of better access to medical care, better nutrition and greater vaccination coverage, global mortality rates in children have declined by more than 30% since 2000. In high-income countries, CAP mainly affects adults 65 years and older and, in general, the incidence of CAP and risk of death increase with age <em>(123)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_368" title="368" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Most likely pathogens</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">In <strong>neonates and children aged up to 2 months</strong>, pneumonia is mainly caused by <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, group B <em>Streptococcus</em>, Enterobacterales or <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>.</p>

    <p>In <strong>children aged 2 months to 5 years</strong>, pneumonia is more likely to be of viral origin (e.g. respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza and parainfluenza virus). The most important bacterial pathogen in children younger than 5 years is <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>. In older children, <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> is still common but “atypical” bacteria such as <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em> and <em>Chlamydia pneumoniae</em> may occur – atypical bacteria have intrinsic resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics and cannot by visualized by Gram staining. <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, <em>Moraxella catarrhalis</em> and <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> also cause CAP in some children (Table 27.1).</p>

    <p>In adults, viruses are common causes of CAP, either by directly causing pneumonia or by favouring superinfection with bacteria. Among bacteria, the most common causative agents are <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, followed by atypical bacteria such as <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em>, <em>Chlamydia pneumoniae</em> and <em>Legionella pneumophila</em>. <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, <em>Moraxella catarrhalis</em> and <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> are also quite common (Table 27.1).</p>

    <p>However, determining the cause of bacterial pneumonia is difficult in all age groups and no causative pathogen is identified in most cases, even if extensive microbiological tests are performed. Furthermore, there may be important geographic differences in the cause of pneumonia; for example, <em>Burkholderia pseudomallei</em> is a cause of CAP in South-East Asia, while <em>Coxiella burnetii</em> is more common in regions with exposure to livestock.</p>

        <li class="box_li">Nasopharyngeal carriage of bacterial pathogens is very common.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>The type of sample (upper respiratory versus lower respiratory origin, blood cultures), the test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, predictive values), the local epidemiology, clinical presentation and, if available, other laboratory test results always need to be considered when deciding whether a positive result for a pathogen likely identifies the causative pathogen.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Antimicrobial resistance is a potential problem with all pathogens associated with CAP. Clinically relevant high-level beta-lactam resistance in <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> is however still rare globally. Resistance to macrolides in <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> and <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em> is highly prevalent in some settings <em>(124,125)</em>. It is important to note that also in the hospital setting, parenteral Access antibiotics such as penicillin/amoxicillin/ampicillin achieve sufficient antibiotic exposure to treat the great majority of <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> isolates.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_370" title="370" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Clinical presentation</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Nearly all respiratory diseases can mimic the symptoms of CAP. Based on clinical features alone it is often impossible to distinguish bacterial from viral pneumonia or from other non-infectious causes; local epidemiology and laboratory tests may help.</p>

    <p>Well established clinical features of CAP include a combination of: new onset (&lt; 2 weeks) of symptoms, worsening cough with or without sputum production, dyspnoea (difficulty in breathing), tachypnoea (abnormal respiratory rates to diagnose rapid breathing vary with age), reduced oxygen saturation, crepitations on lung auscultation, or chest pain or discomfort without an alternative explanation. Fever ≥ 38.0 °C for 3–4 days is usually present but may be absent, especially in elderly people. Extrapulmonary features such as confusion or disorientation may be the main symptoms in elderly people, immunocompromised patients and malnourished children. Severe pneumonia with respiratory distress and sepsis requiring intensive care and intravenous antibiotic treatment has a high associated mortality.</p>

    <p><strong>In children</strong> the WHO defines fast breathing pneumonia as a child with a high respiratory rate for their age (&gt; 50 breaths/minute in children 2–11 months of age; &gt; 40 breaths/minute in children aged 1– 5 years). They may or may not have chest indrawing.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Laboratory tests</strong></h2>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Patient microbiology tests</h3>

    <p class="noindent">In severe cases the following tests could be considered to guide antimicrobial treatment (Table 27.2):</p>

    <ul>
      <li>blood cultures (ideally before starting antibiotic treatment)</li>

      <li>sputum microscopy and culture (ideally before starting antibiotic treatment)</li>

      <li>urinary antigens for <em>Legionella pneumophila</em> and <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Additionally, in certain cases, the following tests could also be considered (Table 27.2):</p>

    <ul>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Using microbiology surveillance data</h3>

    <p class="noindent">In the great majority of episodes of CAP in the hospital setting, parenteral antibiotics produce an exposure sufficient to treat most resistant isolates.</p>

    <p>Routine clinical microbiology samples for CAP are biased towards more severe forms of CAP where more invasive sampling is performed (such as bronchoalveolar lavage) and microbiology results are therefore not representative of the general population with CAP.</p>

    <p>Therefore, routine clinical microbiology surveillance of CAP in the hospital setting does not help to inform local empiric guidance.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Imaging</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">When severe CAP is suspected clinically, a chest X-ray is needed because other conditions have similar clinical features and antibiotics may be avoided if the chest X-ray does not suggest bacterial pneumonia. Furthermore, chest X-rays can be difficult to interpret, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_375" title="375" role="doc-pagebreak"/>especially those of elderly people, and many other conditions (such as heart failure) can mimic infectious infiltrates. In addition, the absence of a visible infiltrate does not always rule out pneumonia (e.g. in dehydrated patients). As with any test, the pre-test probability of pneumonia based on clinical picture and laboratory tests if available and the likelihood of alternative diagnoses need to be considered when interpreting chest X-rays. It should also be noted that the radiographic pattern cannot be used to accurately predict the microbial cause and does not reliably distinguish typical from atypical or viral pathogens.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Scores to determine disease severity and guide treatment decisions</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">WHO recommends that children who meet the criteria of severe pneumonia should be admitted to hospital. As a general rule for children, hospitalization is indicated in cases of severe illness (e.g. cough and severe respiratory distress, marked tachypnoea and tachycardia) and/or if the child is unable to take oral therapy.</p>

    <p><strong>In children</strong>, severe pneumonia is characterized by signs of pneumonia (fast breathing with or without chest indrawing) plus a general danger sign, such as inability to breastfeed or drink, convulsions, lethargy or a reduced level of consciousness <em>(118)</em>.</p>

    <p><strong>In adults</strong>, several scores exist that measure severity and help predict 30-day mortality. These scores, in addition to clinical judgement, can be used to determine the need for hospitalization in immunocompetent adults diagnosed with CAP. In view of its simplicity, one of the more frequently used scores is the CURB-65 <em>(127)</em>, or its modification, CRB-65, which does not require laboratory values for its calculation (Table 27.4). However, it should be noted that these scores have not been extensively validated in low- and middle-income countries or settings and therefore there is no clear consensus about their use in these settings <em>(128)</em>. As well as severity scores, other factors, such as severe comorbid illnesses (e.g. HIV infection) or inability to maintain oral therapy, should always be taken into account in determining the need for hospital admission.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Ruling out tuberculosis</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">TB is a cause of subacute lower respiratory tract infection and should be considered in settings endemic for TB, especially in high-risk patients (e.g. children or adults with HIV), with a slow onset of symptoms and persistent cough, or those who do not respond to the initial antibiotic treatment. In such cases, specific investigations for TB should be done. A rapid molecular test (GeneXpert® MTB/RIF assay) performed on a single sputum specimen is currently the preferred first-line diagnostic test for pulmonary TB and to detect rifampicin resistance in both children and adults. When this rapid test is not available, microscopy examination of sputum smears could be considered for the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_377" title="377" role="doc-pagebreak"/>detection of acid-fast bacilli <em>(129)</em>. For TB management and treatment, refer to the <em>WHO consolidated guidelines on tuberculosis (119)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Symptomatic care</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Patients with severe CAP should receive appropriate oxygen therapy. Routine treatment with corticosteroids is usually not needed unless otherwise indicated <em>(287–290)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Antibiotic treatment</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">The primary goal of empiric antibiotic treatment in CAP is to provide effective and timely treatment for <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> infection, because this is the predominant bacterial pathogen, and untreated pneumococcal pneumonia is associated with high mortality (see Table 27.5 for adults and Table 27.6 for children for treatment recommendations). While ceftriaxone co-prescribed with clarithromycin is the first-choice recommended option, other less broad-spectrum options (e.g. intravenous amoxicillin or benzylpenicillin co-prescribed with clarithromycin) could be considered, especially in less severe cases not requiring intensive care unit admission.</p>

    <p>Empiric treatment should be guided by the age of the patient, severity of symptoms, presence of comorbidities and previous antibiotic treatment. In certain cases (e.g. immunocompromised patients), the epidemiology of antibiotic resistance for common pathogens causing CAP in the setting in which the patient is being treated could be considered.</p>

    <p>Clinical improvement should be evident within 48–72 hours of starting antibiotic therapy. If there is no response to treatment, a complication (such as empyema) should be considered. Duration of treatment should be guided by measures of clinical improvement (e.g. resolution of fever); usually 5 days of treatment are adequate for adults and 3–5 days in children.</p>

    <p><strong>Simplify</strong> empiric treatment to a more narrow-spectrum antibiotic (also called de-escalation) based on culture results (targeted treatment) or based on rapid clinical improvement when no microbiology test results are available.</p>

    <p><strong>Step-down</strong> to oral treatment is based on improvement of symptoms and signs of infection and the ability to take oral antibiotics allowing discharge of the patient home when clinically appropriate.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Prevention</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Vaccination can prevent many cases of CAP. Available vaccines are active against pneumococcal infection, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b disease and influenza, and several vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are available. Vaccines are never 100% effective and because they are serogroup-specific, they do not protect against all strains of bacteria or viruses. Duration of protection is also variable. As a result, even vaccinated people can develop CAP. <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b conjugate vaccines and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines should be included in all routine infant immunization programmes as they have been very successful in reducing invasive disease and, in many countries, rates of pneumococcal resistance. Countries should consider the inclusion of yearly seasonal influenza vaccination for high-risk populations (pregnant women, elderly people, patients with chronic medical conditions and health care workers) in their vaccination plan.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Definition</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is an acute illness affecting the lungs caused by pathogens present in the hospital setting and presenting 48 hours or more after admission. If pneumonia develops while the patient is on a ventilator, HAP is also called ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Of note, the cut-off of 48 hours after admission is chosen for convenience and surveillance purposes. Depending on the situation (particularly in non-ventilated patients), even pneumonias occurring several days to weeks after hospitalization can be caused by pathogens known to cause CAP, while nosocomial pathogens can be acquired and cause infection in patients hospitalized for fewer than 48 hours.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_386" title="386" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Colonization of the oropharynx by bacteria from the hospital environment, aspiration of secretions into the lower respiratory tract and compromised host defence mechanisms are all implicated in the pathogenesis of HAP. Pathogens can also reach the lung alveoli through the blood or by direct spread (e.g. from an infection of the pleural or intra-abdominal space). Secretions may become contaminated with bacteria (including with multidrug-resistant strains) during patient care despite infection prevention and control efforts. Inhalation of pathogens (mostly viruses) is another mechanism of infection to consider, especially during epidemic seasons or during pandemics such as COVID-19.</p>

    <p>The presence of an endotracheal tube is a major risk factor for pneumonia (VAP) because the mechanisms that usually prevent the microaspiration of secretions into the lower respiratory tract are bypassed and also because biofilms (where bacteria can survive and multiply) can form on the internal and external surfaces of the tracheal cannula.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Epidemiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Health care-associated infections are frequent across the world – around a quarter of all hospital antibiotic prescriptions were for health care-associated infections in a 2015 global survey in more than 50 countries <em>(291)</em> and HAP is an important health care-associated infection. The incidence of HAP can vary between hospitals, depending on the patient population being evaluated and the case definition used. However, the incidence is overall higher in mechanically ventilated patients treated in intensive care units than in non-ventilated patients not requiring intensive care <em>(292)</em>.</p>

    <p>Risk factors for HAP in non-ventilated patients include: (i) patient-related factors such as swallowing dysfunction and severe underlying medical conditions (e.g. immunosuppression, chronic lung disease); and (ii) treatment-related factors such as mechanical ventilation (for VAP) and feeding through a nasogastric tube, because their presence can lead to aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions into the lower respiratory tract. These conditions are particularly common in elderly and frail patients <em>(293)</em>. HAP is associated with higher in-hospital mortality than CAP, and VAP is the form of HAP with the highest mortality <em>(293,294)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Most likely pathogens</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">HAP may be caused by the same pathogens found in CAP or by multidrug-resistant pathogens (Table 28.1). In general antibiotic resistance is more prevalent in hospital-acquired strains but the frequency of multidrug-resistant pathogens varies between hospitals and different patient populations. Usually, the risk of infection with multidrug-<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_387" title="387" role="doc-pagebreak"/>resistant pathogens is increased in patients with HAP because they have often been exposed to different regimens of antibiotics before developing HAP. The risk increases with prolonged hospitalization (higher risk of transmission, more antibiotic use) especially if in a critical care setting and in intubated patients. It is important to note that most data on the microbiological etiology of HAP come from ventilated patients in an intensive care setting because samples from the lower respiratory tract can be relatively easily obtained. In contrast, in non-ventilated patients, bronchoalveolar lavage is associated with a risk of respiratory deterioration and non-invasive sampling techniques are often not sufficient to obtain an accurate microbiological diagnosis of etiologic agents in pneumonia.</p>

Pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray may be caused by a variety of non-infectious conditions and the clinical presentation may be very non-specific. There is considerable interobserver variability among specialists in the diagnosis of HAP. It is important to consider the possibility of over diagnosis of HAP and think about stopping antibiotic treatment if HAP is ruled out or an alternative diagnosis can be made.</p>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Patient microbiology tests</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Tests to be considered to guide antimicrobial treatment of HAP are shown in Table 28.2.</p>

    <p>However, most patients will not have culture data to guide antibiotic treatment. In addition, in people with HAP, the respiratory tract is often colonized with bacteria and a positive culture may indicate colonization rather than an acute infection, especially if the sample was obtained by non-invasive methods.</p>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Using microbiology surveillance data</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Routine microbiology surveillance of isolates associated with HAP and their antibiotic susceptibilities could help inform local empiric guidance. Therefore, empiric guidance given by the AWaRe book could be reviewed and adapted based on local clinically relevant microbiology surveillance data.</p>

    <p>However, clinically relevant data for this infection would be derived from local hospital blood culture and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cultures taken from patients in intensive care who were diagnosed with HAP or VAP. Caution should be taken with surveillance of routine respiratory sampling culture data from patients with HAP or VAP due to the high rates of colonization seen in many settings.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Imaging</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">When HAP (or VAP) is suspected clinically, a chest X-ray should be obtained. HAP (or VAP) presents with clinical signs and symptoms along with a new or worsening pulmonary infiltrate on a chest X-ray and leukocytosis.</p>

    <p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_391" title="391" role="doc-pagebreak"/>A chest X-ray is needed because other conditions have similar clinical features and antibiotics may be avoided if the chest X-ray does not suggest bacterial pneumonia. Chest X-rays can be difficult to interpret and to correlate with the clinical presentation (especially in elderly people where the clinical presentation is usually non-specific), and many other conditions (such as heart failure) can mimic infectious infiltrates. Therefore, caution is warranted to avoid over-diagnosis and overtreatment with antibiotics. It should also be noted that the radiographic pattern cannot be used to accurately predict the microbial etiology.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Antibiotic treatment</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Empiric treatment should be guided by the severity of symptoms (scoring systems to evaluate disease severity exist but they are beyond the scope of this chapter) and by risk factors for multidrug-resistant infections. In particular, individualized assessment should be done based on risk factors such as: previous antibiotic treatment (e.g. in the 90 days preceding the infection); prolonged hospital stay, particularly in the intensive care unit (&gt; 5 days); previous colonization with multidrug-resistant pathogens; and a high local prevalence of multidrug-resistant pathogens (among potential causative pathogens of HAP, such as <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and Gram-negative bacteria including <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>).</p>

    <p>Antibiotic options to consider for empiric treatment in patients with HAP (non-VAP) are given in Table 28.4. Treatment should always be tailored to culture results once these become available.</p>

    <p>Empiric treatment in patients with VAP should be chosen considering the time from intensive care unit admission/intubation to symptom onset. In ventilated patients (as with non-ventilated patients who develop HAP), infections that develop early (e.g. a few days after admission) are unlikely to be caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens or <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> and could safely be treated with amoxicillin+clavulanic acid. At the other end, an antibiotic with a broader spectrum of activity (and active against <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>) is preferable in cases with a longer time interval between admission to hospital and onset of symptoms.</p>

    <p>There are some areas of uncertainty about empiric treatment for HAP.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Adding vancomycin to the first-choice antibiotic options as an empiric treatment when MRSA infection is suspected; for example, in settings with a high prevalence of <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> isolates that are methicillin resistant and in patients known to be colonized by MRSA.</li>

      <li>The need for empiric double coverage against <em>Pseudomonas</em> to improve coverage in severely ill patients (e.g. with septic shock or in need of ventilator support) because of the risk of infection caused by <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> isolates resistant to an antibiotic used for monotherapy. The need for empiric double <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_392" title="392" role="doc-pagebreak"/>coverage could therefore be considered in severely ill patients with VAP (or with severe HAP requiring ventilator support) on a case-by-case basis based on local antibiotic resistance data and the personal history of the patient, such as known respiratory colonization with multidrug-resistant <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, particularly in patients with underlying chronic lung disease. However, specific antibiotic combinations to use in these cases are not covered in the AWaRe book as they are currently not included in the EML and EMLc with which this book is closely aligned.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Simplify</strong> empiric treatment to a more narrow-spectrum antibiotic (often also called de-escalation) based on culture results (targeted treatment) or based on rapid clinical improvement when no microbiology test results are available.</p>

    <p><strong>Step-down</strong> to oral treatment is based on improvement of symptoms and signs of infection and the ability to take oral antibiotics allowing discharge of the patient home when clinically appropriate.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Prevention</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">A detailed discussion of the prevention of HAP and VAP is beyond the scope of this chapter; however, key general principles are presented. Some measures such as vaccination against pathogens that can commonly cause pneumonia overlap with those presented in the chapter on CAP. Specific measures that apply to the hospital setting include: maintaining mobility, good oral and dental care, maintaining adequate nutritional support in hospital, elevating the head of the bed to reduce the chances of aspirating respiratory secretions into the lower lungs, avoiding intubation or reducing its duration as much as possible, and good hand hygiene. Good hand hygiene applies to patients and staff or family caregivers that come into contact with patients during the hospital stay. In addition, in the intensive care unit, locally adapted bundles of interventions to prevent VAP are usually in place and include, for example, maintaining adequate endotracheal tube cuff pressure, minimizing sedation and assessing regularly if the endotracheal tube can be removed in order to extubate patients as soon as it is safe to do so.</p>

    <p>Selective oral decontamination and/or selective decontamination of the digestive tract can also be considered based on local intensive care unit protocols. These preventive measures have been extensively studied to prevent hospital-acquired infections. The <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_395" title="395" role="doc-pagebreak"/>rationale for their use is to reduce the bacterial burden of the upper (with selective oral decontamination) and lower (with selective decontamination of the digestive tract) digestive tract through the administration of non-absorbable antibiotics – topical antibiotics applied to the oropharynx for selective oral decontamination and non-absorbable antibiotics administered through nasogastric tube for selective decontamination of the digestive tract. Evidence exists that these practices can help reduce the incidence of VAP but there is important concern about the risk of selecting resistant bacteria.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Definition</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Acute cholecystitis is an acute inflammation of the gallbladder and acute cholangitis is an acute inflammation in the bile duct system. Both conditions are classified as uncomplicated when there is no involvement of the peritoneal cavity and the inflammation is confined to the organ involved, that is no perforation, no abscess and no diffuse peritonitis. The conditions are classified as complicated when the inflammation extends to the peritoneal cavity with subsequent peritonitis or when an abscess is present.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_402" title="402" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">In acute cholecystitis, a gallstone obstructing the cystic duct for prolonged periods of time and causing inflammation of the gallbladder is the most frequent cause (&gt; 90%). Acalculous cholecystitis, where there is no evidence of gallstones or cystic duct obstruction, is uncommon, especially in adults. Rarely, certain parasites (e.g. the worm <em>Ascaris lumbricoides</em>) can also cause gallbladder perforation.</p>

    <p>In acute cholangitis, the most common cause is choledocholithiasis (i.e. gallstones in the bile duct). Infection occurs when bacteria travel up the biliary tract from the intestine or via the portal venous system. Another cause may be obstruction by tumours (e.g. pancreatic cancer) or parasites (e.g. the liver fluke <em>Fasciola hepatica</em>) <em>(295)</em>. In addition, congenital biliary strictures or strictures following inflammation or infection can cause acute cholangitis.</p>

    <p>In both cholecystitis and cholangitis, if bacterial contamination or chemical irritation (usually due to leakage of sterile fluids that are irritants to the peritoneum, for example, bile or blood) of the peritoneal cavity occur, peritonitis develops. Abdominal abscesses (i.e. the presence of a collection of infected fluid in the peritoneal cavity) can also form as a result of a complicated infection.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Epidemiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Acute cholecystitis is a common surgical emergency worldwide. The incidence of acute cholecystitis is declining where cholecystectomy (surgical removal of the gallbladder) has become a common procedure in cases of recurrent attacks of biliary colic, that is, intermittent pain in the upper abdomen, usually on the right side. Acute cholecystitis mostly affects adults; children are rarely affected. The disease is more prevalent in men and elderly people. Obesity and diabetes are also well known risk factors <em>(296,297)</em>. Short-term 30-day mortality is about 5% in severe cases and 1% in mild cases <em>(298)</em>.</p>

    <p>Acute cholangitis is a condition associated with high mortality if left untreated. Choledocholithiasis and malignant obstruction by tumours are the most common causes of cholangitis and their risk factors overlap <em>(299)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Most likely pathogens</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">The most common pathogens involved in acute cholecystitis or cholangitis are Gram-negative bacilli and anaerobic bacteria from the intestinal microbiota (Table 29.1). Infections are often caused by more than one pathogen and may include fungal pathogens, especially in patients who have recently received antibiotic treatment. Certain parasites (<em>Ascaris lumbricoides</em>, <em>Fasciola hepatica</em>) need to be considered in endemic settings as they may cause biliary obstruction leading to bacterial complications.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Clinical presentation</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Acute cholecystitis should be considered as a possible diagnosis in all cases of acute abdominal pain, especially if the pain is predominantly located in the right upper quadrant.</p>

    <p>Acute cholangitis should be considered a possible diagnosis in all cases presenting with abdominal pain, fever and jaundice, that is, yellow skin colour and sclera due to increased levels of bilirubin.</p>

    <p>Fever (≥ 38.0 °C), chills, nausea and vomiting may be present, mostly in complicated infections. Severe pain, diffuse rebound tenderness on sudden release of pressure on the abdomen and abdominal muscular defence are usually present in cases of peritonitis. Hypotension and signs of organ hypoperfusion (e.g. reduced urine output) may be present in cases of organ failure and are a medical and/or surgical emergency. Please also refer to the chapter on sepsis if suspected.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Laboratory tests</strong></h2>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Patient microbiology tests</h3>

    <p class="noindent">In mild cases, routine microbiology tests are not usually needed and basing antibiotic treatment on pathogens cultured from the abdominal cavity at the time of operation is not recommended. Blood cultures and other microbiology tests could be considered in severely ill patients in order to adjust empiric antibiotic treatment once the results of susceptibility tests are available (see Table 29.2).</p>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Using microbiology surveillance data</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Routine surveillance of pathogens cultured from the abdominal cavity is not recommended.</p>

    <p>Empiric guidance given by the AWaRe book could be reviewed and adapted based on local clinically relevant microbiology surveillance data. For example, clinically relevant isolates for this infection would be blood culture data from patients on surgical wards with intra-abdominal infections.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Imaging</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Imaging is helpful to confirm cholecystitis and cholangitis. An abdominal ultrasound should always be considered when these conditions are suspected. Where available, a CT scan of the abdomen may also be considered, especially if complications are suspected or the diagnosis is uncertain.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Treatment of acute cholecystitis</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Patients with suspected or confirmed acute cholecystitis should be promptly referred for surgical consultation. Eliminating the source of infection and the ongoing contamination of the peritoneal cavity (e.g. in case of perforation) is the most important surgical intervention. Cholecystectomy (i.e. removal of the gallbladder) is the only definitive treatment and an antibiotic should be given until the gallbladder is removed <em>(300)</em>. After surgery, in uncomplicated cases, antibiotic treatment can be stopped provided the source of infection was adequately controlled and there is good clinical recovery. In severe cases (i.e. critically ill patients), 5 days of antibiotic treatment are usually adequate, provided there is good clinical recovery and the source of infection was adequately controlled and eliminated with surgery <em>(301)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_406" title="406" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Treatment of acute cholangitis</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Biliary drainage is the main surgical intervention for acute cholangitis and antibiotic treatment should be given in all cases irrespective of severity. Antibiotic treatment should be given until drainage procedures are done and continued for a total of 5 days once control of the source of infection has been achieved <em>(301)</em>. Shorter courses of antibiotics (e.g. 3 days) have been evaluated in observational studies (and in a systematic review) and were not associated with a higher occurrence of complications; however, this practice remains controversial because the evidence is not strong <em>(302,303)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Antibiotic treatment</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Empiric antibiotic treatment should be chosen based on the severity of symptoms, mild or severe (Table 29.4), considering local prevalence of resistance, particularly isolates producing ESBLs since the prevalence can vary greatly in different settings <em>(304)</em>. Individual risk factors for resistant pathogens (e.g. recent antibiotic treatment, colonization with resistant pathogens) should also be considered.</p>

    <p><strong>Simplify</strong> empiric treatment to a more narrow-spectrum antibiotic (often also called de-escalation) based on culture results (targeted treatment) or based on rapid clinical improvement when no microbiology test results are available.</p>

    <p><strong>Step-down</strong> to oral treatment is based on improvement of symptoms and signs of infection and the ability to take oral antibiotics allowing discharge of the patient home when clinically appropriate.</p>

    <p>If signs and symptoms persist, abdominal imaging is suggested, or an alternative extra-abdominal source of infection should be considered.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_420" title="420" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">A pyogenic liver abscess develops when a biliary infection spreads directly to the liver or when a complicated intra-abdominal infection spreads to the liver via the portal circulation. In cases of systemic infection, the infection may also spread to the liver via the bloodstream.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Epidemiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Pyogenic liver abscess is the most common type of visceral abscess <em>(305)</em>. It is frequently associated with male sex and diabetes. Pyogenic liver abscess is more common in South-East Asia <em>(306)</em> probably due to the different epidemiology of certain causative pathogens, such as <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>. Underlying hepatobiliary or pancreatic diseases (e.g. malignancy, cirrhosis, recent abdominal or biliary surgery) are common risk factors. Abscess rupture is a rare but severe complication associated with a high mortality if not treated immediately.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Most likely pathogens</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Most cases of liver abscess are caused by enteric Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobes and most cases involve more than one pathogen (Table 30.1) <em>(307)</em>. A hypervirulent strain of <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> is an increasingly common cause of liver abscess in Asia <em>(308,309)</em>. <em>Burkholderia pseudomallei</em> (a Gram-negative bacterium found in soil and water and transmitted by inhalation or ingestion or inoculation) is also a cause of liver abscess in endemic countries, mostly in South-East Asia and in Australia.</p>

    <p>Parasites, notably <em>Entamoeba histolytica</em> (acquired by ingestion of contaminated food or water), are another frequent cause of liver abscess in endemic settings: Indian subcontinent, Africa, and Central and South America <em>(310,311)</em>.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Pyogenic liver abscess should be considered in all cases of fever (≥ 38.0 °C) and abdominal pain, mostly localized in the right upper abdominal quadrant. Vomiting, nausea, anorexia, malaise and jaundice are other common symptoms.</p>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Patient microbiology tests</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Whenever possible, a microbiology sample should be obtained (see Table 30.2) to guide antibiotic treatment. Ideally, the sample should be obtained before antibiotic treatment is started. The reason for doing microbiology tests is to determine the type of pathogen causing infection and its resistance profile in order to provide adequate treatment <em>(312)</em>.</p>

              <p class="legenda"><sup>a</sup> <em>Entamoeba histolytica</em> is not a cause of pyogenic abscess but a cause of liver abscess that needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis in endemic settings. However, patients with amoebic liver abscess usually have no bowel symptoms; therefore, stool testing (microscopy or antigen) has a low sensitivity and is of limited usefulness for diagnosis.</p>

              <p class="legenda"><sup>b</sup> Antigen or nucleic acid amplification testing of abscess aspirate material for <em>Entamoeba histolytica</em> could be considered where available. Diagnosis is often difficult in low- and middle-income countries due to limited laboratory resources and the fact that most patients present after a failed course of antibiotic treatment for pyogenic abscess; therefore the yield of any microbiology tests is lower <em>(311,312)</em>.</p>

              <p class="legenda"><sup>c</sup> This test is not in the WHO EDL <em>(6)</em>.</p>

              <p class="legenda"><sup>d</sup> Serology is a useful test in the diagnosis of invasive amoebiasis and is positive in more than 90% of patients with the disease. A positive serology combined with a compatible clinical presentation suggests active disease. However, in endemic settings, a positive result is more difficult to interpret since serology can remain positive for months and even years after resolution of the infection. Therefore, past and current infections become difficult to distinguish. With negative results, if the clinical suspicion of invasive amoebiasis is still strong, serology could be repeated after 1 week.</p>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Using microbiology surveillance data</h3>

    <p class="noindent">There is no role for routine surveillance to inform empiric guidance.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Imaging</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Imaging is very helpful in the diagnosis of pyogenic liver abscess. An abdominal ultrasound should always be considered when this condition is suspected. In settings where it is available, a CT scan of the abdomen may also be considered, especially if complications are suspected or the diagnosis is uncertain.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Treatment</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Early control of the source of infection through drainage of the abscess is usually required when feasible in addition to antibiotic treatment, especially for large (&gt; 5 cm) abscesses. Drainage is recommended because larger abscesses have a higher risk of rupture.</p>

    <p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_424" title="424" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Drainage techniques include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Percutaneous drainage (image-guided procedure that is usually performed by an interventional radiologist where available). A drain – usually a pigtail catheter – is inserted through the skin into the abscess and left in place until the collection is drained.</li>

      <li>Surgical drainage. This is done either as a conventional open procedure (i.e. laparotomy) or by laparoscopy.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In both cases, the drainage procedure is also important for diagnostic purposes to identify the type of pathogen causing the abscess and its resistance profile. Abscess material should therefore be obtained for culture when the drain is placed or the abscess is surgically removed.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Antibiotic treatment</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">In patients who are clinically stable, targeted treatment based on the results of microbiology tests is always preferred. In particular, infections caused by Enterobacterales producing ESBL or carbapenemases need to be considered in patients with history of hospitalization or previously colonized or infected with these resistant pathogens as their prevalence varies greatly in different settings.</p>

    <p>In more severe cases, empiric treatment is given, taking into account the most probable type of causative pathogen (including the possibility of <em>Entamoeba histolytica</em> infection) and local prevalence of resistance, especially for ESBL- and carbapenemase-producing isolates (see Table 30.4). Individual risk factors for resistant pathogens (e.g. recent antibiotic treatment, colonization or previous infections with resistant isolates) should also considered.</p>

    <p>The total duration of treatment is usually long (weeks) and depends on whether control of the source of infection is achieved and on the causative pathogen. Therefore, early control of the source of infection and identification of the causative pathogen are encouraged. In most cases, at least 4 weeks of antibiotic treatment are needed with follow-up imaging (if available) to monitor response and define treatment duration.</p>

    <p>Longer duration of treatment is required in cases of liver abscess caused by <em>Burkholderia pseudomallei</em> – usually 2 weeks of intravenous treatment followed by &gt; 3 months of oral treatment with sulfamethoxazole+trimethoprim to eradicate the infection and prevent relapse or recurrence. In cases of amoebic liver abscess, a 10-day course of treatment (with oral metronidazole) is usually adequate.</p>

    <p><strong>Simplify</strong> empiric treatment to a more narrow-spectrum antibiotic (often also called de-escalation) based on culture results (targeted treatment) or based on rapid clinical <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_425" title="425" role="doc-pagebreak"/>improvement when no microbiology test results are available. In general, the intravenous route is preferred for the initial phase of treatment.</p>

    <p><strong>Step-down</strong> to oral treatment is based on improvement of symptoms and signs of infection and the ability to take oral antibiotics allowing discharge of the patient home when clinically appropriate.</p>

    <p>Oral step-down therapy can be considered quickly for mild cases after adequate drainage and confirmed microbiology and susceptibility.</p>

    <p>If signs and symptoms persist, abdominal imaging is suggested, or an alternative extra-abdominal source of infection should be considered.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Definition</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Appendicitis is an acute inflammation of the appendix sometimes followed by ischaemia and perforation. It is usually classified as uncomplicated (or simple) when there is no involvement of the peritoneal cavity and no abscess. When the appendix is perforated with subsequent peritonitis or when an abscess is present, appendicitis is defined as complicated. Most cases of appendicitis are uncomplicated (70%).</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_440" title="440" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">The exact mechanism leading to appendicitis is poorly understood. Conditions associated with a higher risk of weakening and disrupting the normal anatomical barrier of the appendix or that can cause its luminal obstruction could be involved. In children, lymphoid hyperplasia can contribute to the risk of developing appendicitis. Rarely, parasitic infections (mostly <em>Enterobius vermicularis</em> (pinworm)) can contribute to the development of acute appendicitis <em>(313)</em>.</p>

    <p>Perforation is usually the result of gangrene and a necrotic process and can lead to localized abscess formation or to peritonitis when the leak is not contained by structures surrounding the appendix.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Epidemiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency worldwide, especially in children and young adults. The yearly incidence of appendicitis has been declining in western European and North American countries since the 1990s and has stabilized in the past 20 years to about 100–150 cases per 100 000 person-years. However, increasing trends are reported in Asia, South America and the Middle East with the incidence of appendicitis higher than in many western European and North American countries <em>(314)</em>. In 2017, there were an estimated 19 million new cases worldwide <em>(44)</em>. The lifetime risk of appendicitis reported in the literature varies across countries, ranging from about 2% in Africa to 16% in South Korea <em>(315)</em>. Mortality attributable to appendicitis has declined and with prompt diagnosis and management, mortality is now &lt; 1% in uncomplicated cases in most settings <em>(316)</em>. Complicated cases or cases in elderly people are associated with a higher mortality.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Most likely pathogens</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">The most common pathogens involved in appendicitis are Gram-negative bacilli and anaerobes from the intestinal microbiota (Table 31.1). Infections are often caused by more than one pathogen and may include fungal pathogens, especially in patients who have recently received antibiotic treatment. Certain parasites need to be considered in the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain in endemic settings.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Clinical presentation</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Acute appendicitis should be considered as a possible diagnosis in all cases of acute abdominal pain, especially if the pain is in the right lower quadrant or is moving from the periumbilical area to the right lower quadrant. Nausea and vomiting are usually present. Fever (≥ 38.0 °C) and rigors can be present.</p>

    <p>Severe pain, diffuse rebound tenderness on sudden release of pressure on the abdomen and abdominal muscular tensing are usually present in cases of peritonitis. Hypotension and signs of organ hypoperfusion (e.g. reduced urine output) may be present in cases of organ failure and are a medical and/or surgical emergency. Please also refer to the chapter on sepsis if suspected.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Laboratory tests</strong></h2>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Patient microbiology tests</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Routine microbiology tests are not usually needed and basing antibiotic treatment on pathogens cultured from the abdominal cavity at the time of operation is not recommended. However, certain microbiology tests could be considered in severely ill patients to adjust empiric antibiotic treatment once the results of antibiotic susceptibility tests are available (Table 31.2).</p>

    <p>In more severe cases, blood cultures should be taken and samples from the abdominal cavity may be useful in certain situations such as severely immunocompromised <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_442" title="442" role="doc-pagebreak"/>patients or patients known to be colonized with multidrug-resistant organisms or in patients presenting with septic shock.</p>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Using microbiology surveillance data</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Routine surveillance of pathogens cultured from the abdominal cavity is not recommended.</p>

    <p>Empiric guidance given by the AWaRe book could be reviewed and adapted based on local clinically relevant microbiology surveillance data. For example, clinically relevant isolates for this infection would be blood culture data from patients on surgical wards with intra-abdominal infections.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Imaging</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Imaging is helpful to confirm acute appendicitis. An abdominal ultrasound should always be considered when this condition is suspected. Where available a CT scan of the abdomen may also be considered, especially if complications are suspected or the diagnosis is uncertain.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Treatment</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Surgery to eliminate/control the source of infection (e.g. abscess, perforated appendix) and reduce contamination of the peritoneal cavity (e.g. in cases of perforation) are the foundation of treatment. Patients with suspected or confirmed appendicitis should be promptly referred for surgical consultation and antibiotic treatment should be started quickly.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Uncomplicated cases treated with antibiotics alone</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Treating appendicitis with antibiotics alone is controversial – and not recommended by WHO for children – mostly because of the higher risk of recurrences within a year <em>(317–319)</em>. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_444" title="444" role="doc-pagebreak"/>However, this approach can be considered in adults in certain cases if close monitoring is possible, given that one in three patients treated this way will experience a recurrence within 2 years <em>(320)</em>. Patient preference should be one element considered when deciding the approach, that is, avoidance of surgery versus higher risk of recurrence with antibiotics.</p>

    <p>When antibiotic treatment alone is offered, the suggested duration of treatment is 7 days provided there is a good clinical response with resolution of symptoms. Patients should be re-evaluated to assess the need for surgical intervention if they do not improve on antibiotics alone.</p>

    <p>As stated above, in children with acute appendicitis, WHO discourages this approach in the <em>Pocket book of hospital care for children</em>: “appendectomy should be done as soon as possible to prevent perforation, peritonitis and abscess formation. It is better to operate and be wrong about the diagnosis than to delay and have peritonitis occur” <em>(31)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Antibiotic treatment</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">In general, empiric antibiotic treatment should be chosen based on the severity of symptoms (mild or severe), considering local prevalence of resistance, particularly isolates producing ESBLs, since prevalence can vary greatly among different settings (Table 31.5). Individual risk factors for resistant pathogens (e.g. recent antibiotic treatment, colonization with resistant pathogens) could also be considered.</p>

    <p><strong>Simplify</strong> empiric treatment to a more narrow-spectrum antibiotic (often also called de-escalation) based on culture results (targeted treatment) or based on rapid clinical improvement when no microbiology test results are available. It should be noted that anaerobes are difficult to culture and anaerobic coverage should usually be continued even if no anaerobes are detected in microbiologic samples.</p>

    <p><strong>Step-down</strong> to oral treatment is based on improvement of symptoms and signs of infection and the ability to take oral antibiotics allowing discharge of the patient home when clinically appropriate.</p>

    <p>If signs and symptoms persist, abdominal imaging is suggested, or an alternative extra-abdominal source of infection should be considered.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Definition</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Acute diverticulitis is the acute inflammation of diverticula (sac-like protrusions of the wall of the colon) that can cause severe abdominal pain. Acute diverticulitis is usually classified as uncomplicated when there is no involvement of the peritoneal cavity and the inflammation is localized to the diverticula, for example, no perforation, no abscess, no diffuse peritonitis. When the inflammation extends to the peritoneal cavity or when an abscess is present, the condition is considered complicated.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_457" title="457" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">In cases of acute diverticulitis, the first step in the pathogenesis is the formation of diverticula (i.e. diverticulosis). Diverticula are sac-like protrusions of the colonic wall. The mechanism leading to diverticulitis of the colon is the erosion of the wall of the diverticula by increased intraluminal pressure. If bacterial contamination and chemical irritation (usually due to leakage of sterile fluids that are irritants to the peritoneum; for example, bile or blood) of the peritoneal cavity occur, peritonitis develops. Intra-abdominal abscesses (i.e. the presence of a collection of infected fluid in the peritoneal cavity) can also form as a result of a complicated diverticulitis.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Epidemiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Acute diverticulitis is common in high-income countries and mostly affects adults older than 50 years; its incidence increases with age. The condition is less frequent in many low- and middle-income countries, probably because of differences in the fibre content of diets. The overall risk of developing acute diverticulitis in patients with diverticulosis is low <em>(324,325)</em> and most cases (&gt; 80%) are uncomplicated. Nonetheless, acute diverticulitis is still a common cause of colonic resection <em>(326)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Most likely pathogens</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">The most common pathogens involved in acute diverticulitis are Gram-negative bacilli and anaerobic bacteria from the intestinal microbiota (Table 32.1). Infections are often caused by more than one pathogen and may include fungal pathogens, especially in patients pre-treated with antibiotics. Certain parasites need to be considered in the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain in endemic settings.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Clinical presentation</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Acute diverticulitis should be considered as a possible diagnosis in all cases of acute pain in the left lower abdominal quadrant. It should be noted that while left lower diverticulitis is more prevalent in European countries and North America, right lower diverticulitis is more common in Asia.</p>

    <p>Fever (≥ 38.0 °C), chills, nausea and vomiting may be present, mostly in complicated diverticulitis. Severe pain, diffuse rebound tenderness on sudden release of pressure on the abdomen and abdominal muscular defence are usually present in cases of peritonitis. Hypotension and signs of organ hypoperfusion (e.g. reduced urine output) can be present in cases of organ failure and are a medical and /or surgical emergency. Please also refer to the chapter on sepsis if suspected.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Laboratory tests</strong></h2>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Patient microbiology tests</h3>

    <p class="noindent">In mild cases, routine microbiology tests are not usually needed and basing antibiotic treatment on pathogens cultured from the abdominal cavity at the time of operation is not recommended. Certain microbiology tests (Table 32.2) could be considered in severely ill patients to adjust empiric antibiotic treatment once the results of antibiotic susceptibility tests are available.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Routine surveillance of pathogens cultured from the abdominal cavity is not recommended.</p>

    <p>Empiric guidance given by the AWaRe book could be reviewed and adapted based on local clinically relevant microbiology surveillance data. For example, clinically relevant isolates for this infection would be blood culture data from patients on surgical wards with intra-abdominal infections.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Imaging</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Imaging is helpful to confirm acute diverticulitis. In settings where CT scanning is available, a scan of the abdomen is the best imaging method to confirm acute diverticulitis and grade its severity. However, because ultrasound is more widely available, abdominal ultrasound can also be considered a valid alternative.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Treatment</strong></h2>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Complicated cases</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Patients with suspected or confirmed complicated acute diverticulitis or with recurrent attacks should be promptly referred for surgical consultation.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Uncomplicated cases</h3>

    <p class="noindent">In immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis (i.e. localized diverticular inflammation) and no signs of systemic inflammation, antibiotic treatment is usually not needed. In these patients, uncomplicated diverticulitis can be considered a self-limiting condition where antibiotics do not offer a benefit in terms of clinical resolution and recurrence <em>(329,330)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Antibiotic treatment</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">In patients with complicated acute diverticulitis or in uncomplicated cases requiring antibiotic treatment (e.g. cases that did not resolve spontaneously after 2–3 days without antibiotic treatment) or in severely immunocompromised patients, empiric antibiotic treatment should be chosen based on the severity of symptoms (mild or severe). It is important to take into account local prevalence of resistance, particularly isolates of Enterobacterales producing ESBLs, since the prevalence can vary greatly among settings (Table 32.4). Individual risk factors for resistant pathogens (e.g. recent antibiotic treatment, colonization with resistant <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_461" title="461" role="doc-pagebreak"/>pathogens) should also be considered. In settings where resistance to carbapenems is highly prevalent, alternative antibiotic options including Reserve antibiotics – see chapter on Reserve antibiotics – could be considered in severely ill patients who are deteriorating. In complicated cases (i.e. presence of perforation or abscess), empiric antibiotic treatment should be started as soon as the diagnosis is suspected and could be stopped 4 days after control of the source of infection is achieved provided there is good clinical recovery.</p>

    <p>Patients with small abscesses (&lt; 5 cm) or pericolic gas are usually treated with systemic antibiotic treatment alone provided close clinical follow up is possible and there is a good clinical response and symptoms have resolved <em>(331)</em>.</p>

    <p>In patients with large abscesses (e.g. percutaneous drainage of abscesses &gt; 5 cm) and patients with peritonitis, control of the source of infection (e.g. colonic resection), in addition to systemic antibiotic treatment, is needed.</p>

    <p><strong>Simplify</strong> empiric treatment to a more narrow-spectrum antibiotic (often also called de-escalation) based on culture results (targeted treatment) or based on rapid clinical improvement when no microbiology test results are available.</p>

    <p><strong>Step-down</strong> to oral treatment is based on improvement of symptoms and signs of infection and the ability to take oral antibiotics allowing discharge of the patient home when clinically appropriate.</p>

    <p>If signs and symptoms persist, abdominal imaging is suggested, or an alternative extra-abdominal source of infection should be considered.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Definition</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent"><em>Clostridioides difficile</em> (formerly <em>Clostridium difficile</em>) infection is an infection of the colon caused by the bacterium <em>Clostridioides difficile</em>. The infection occurs mostly in patients with current or recent antibiotic use. For surveillance purposes, <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> infection is usually classified as either health care-associated or community-associated based on where the infection was acquired, which is determined by the timing of onset of symptoms in relation to last contact with any health care setting.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_468" title="468" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Pathogen</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent"><em>Clostridioides difficile</em> is a Gram-positive anaerobic spore-forming bacterium that is widely present in the environment, especially in hospitals and long-term care facilities where spores can persist in the environment for months. Toxigenic and non-toxigenic strains exist but <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> infection is only associated with toxigenic strains. Of these strains, BI/NAP1/027 is particularly virulent and in recent years has caused outbreaks, especially in North America.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent"><em>Clostridioides difficile</em> infection is acquired through the ingestion of toxigenic spores of the Gram-positive bacterium <em>Clostridioides difficile</em>. Spores are present in stools of symptomatic patients and asymptomatic carriers. Once ingested, the spores can colonize the colonic mucosa, germinate into vegetative bacteria, multiply and produce toxins (toxin A and/or B, binary toxin). In most cases, patients remain asymptomatic. However, if disruption of the normal colonic mucosa and intestinal microbiota occurs (e.g. after exposure to antibiotics or cytotoxic chemotherapy) and if there is no adequate antibody response to <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> toxins, clinical disease can occur. This disease ranges in severity, from mild diarrhoea to life-threatening pseudomembranous colitis and toxic megacolon. Not all strains of <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> produce toxins. Recurrent infections are a frequent problem, especially in elderly and immunocompromised patients, and the risk of relapse increases with each episode.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Epidemiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent"><em>Clostridioides difficile</em> infection is the most frequent cause of health care-associated infectious diarrhoea and is associated with prolonged hospital stay and increased costs <em>(333,334)</em>.</p>

    <p>Common risk factors for <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> infection include age ≥ 65 years, recent use of antibiotics and previous hospital admission <em>(335)</em>. Almost all antibiotics can increase the risk of infection but clindamycin, cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones have been most consistently associated with increased risk of <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> infection – the risk may vary across time and settings based on the resistance/susceptibility of <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> to certain antibiotics. Cytotoxic chemotherapy can also increase the risk of infection because inflammation of the intestinal mucosa (i.e. mucositis) is often present. Patients regularly exposed to health care settings (e.g. patients on dialysis) are also at increased risk.</p>

    <p>In young children (especially younger than 2 years), clinical disease is rare, probably because cellular receptors to <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> toxins develop later in life; therefore, young children are often asymptomatic carriers.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_469" title="469" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Clinical presentation</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">The most common symptom of <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> infection is diarrhoea, usually defined as the presence of at least three unformed or liquid stools in 24 hours (with no other plausible cause), or more than what is normal for that individual. Abdominal pain, cramping and fever may also be present. Signs of severe disease include marked leukocytosis (e.g. white blood cell count &gt; 15 × 10<sup>9</sup> /L or 15 000/μL), severe abdominal pain, high fever and organ dysfunction, for example, elevated serum creatinine and decreased serum albumin.</p>

    <p>Rarely, <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> infection can present with signs and symptoms of toxic megacolon. Patients with this presentation often do not have diarrhoea but have signs of acute surgical abdomen and/or sepsis and may need to be admitted to the intensive care unit. The absence of diarrhoea does therefore not exclude <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> infection. Severe cases may require a colectomy for source control.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Laboratory tests</strong></h2>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Patient microbiology tests</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Where available, a stool test in a symptomatic patient to detect toxigenic <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> (or toxin production) should be considered if the patient has no other reasons for diarrhoea, such as recent use of laxatives. The rationale is that, if infection is detected, an effective treatment can be provided, other antibiotics can be stopped if possible and infection control measures can be put in place (or reinforced) to limit transmission. Testing is not usually recommended in infants because of the high prevalence of colonization; colonization here refers to the presence of <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> in the stool of healthy children.</p>

    <p>Even though the current version of the WHO EDL <em>(6)</em> does not include specific tests for <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> detection, Table 33.1 suggests tests that could be considered based on local availability.</p>

    <p>Currently, no single test is completely reliable in diagnosing <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> infection and the best diagnostic approach to use is controversial <em>(336)</em>. The two following approaches are commonly used and could be considered based on local available tests and laboratory protocols. For both approaches, it is important to limit testing to patients with a sufficiently high pre-test probability of <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> infection, for example, with diarrhoea and risk factors such as current or recent antibiotic use.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Start with a highly sensitive test (nucleic acid amplification test or glutamate dehydrogenase test depending on local availability) that can detect the presence of <em>Clostridioides difficile</em>. Then, confirm positive results with a test that can detect toxin production such as the toxin A/B enzyme immunoassay. It should be noted <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_470" title="470" role="doc-pagebreak"/>that if the toxin production test is negative, the patient could be colonized with <em>Clostridioides difficile</em>and therefore an alternative reason for diarrhoea should be sought.</li>

      <li>Start with two tests at the same time – glutamate dehydrogenase test and toxin A/B enzyme immunoassay. If both tests are positive, <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> infection can be reliably confirmed; if both are negative, <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> infection can be excluded. If the results conflict, then symptomatic patients should be treated if the pre-test probability of <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> infection is sufficiently high, for example, with recent antibiotic exposure and absence of alternative causes of diarrhoea.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In patients diagnosed with <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> infection, repeat testing during the same episode and test of cure are not needed and should be avoided.</p>

    </div>

    <p class="noindent">Symptomatic patients diagnosed with <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> infection should promptly receive adequate antibiotic treatment as indicated in Table 33.3. Whenever possible, it is also important to stop any other antibiotic that could have favoured <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> infection by disrupting the microbiota in the colon. If it is necessary to continue the antibiotic treatment (e.g. because of a clearly documented or high suspicion of a concomitant infection), it is advisable to select antibiotics with lower risk of selecting <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> infection, thus avoid ceftriaxone, fluoroquinolones and clindamycin.</p>

    <p>Oral treatment with metronidazole is appropriate for a first episode of mild to moderate severity. This antibiotic is also suggested because of concerns that oral vancomycin could favour selection of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in the intestinal microbiota and that the oral formulation may be unavailable or too expensive to consider in some low-resource settings <em>(337,338)</em>. However, in severe cases of infection, the current evidence supports the use of oral vancomycin rather than metronidazole, in part because of its benefit in reducing recurrent episodes <em>(337–339)</em>. Treatment of recurrent episodes (usually defined as <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> infection within 8 weeks of a previous episode) with antibiotics or faecal microbiota transplantation is beyond the scope of this chapter.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Definition</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Upper UTIs are acute infections in which pathogens (mostly bacteria from the intestinal microbiota colonizing the skin in the perineal area) reach the kidney/s by ascending through the urethra, bladder and the ureter/s. In addition, pathogens can gain access to the kidney/s through the bloodstream. An infection of the kidney/s is commonly referred to as pyelonephritis. Infections can be community acquired or hospital acquired. The focus of this chapter is on community-acquired pyelonephritis in immunocompetent patients without a urinary catheter.</p>

    <p>Complications can occur with upper UTIs because of patient-related risk factors that make the infection more difficult to treat. While there is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes a complicated UTI, upper UTIs in individuals with pre-existing conditions of the urinary tract (e.g. anatomical anomalies and kidney stones) are generally considered complicated. Upper UTIs in pregnant women are also usually considered complicated. Examples of factors that may increase the risk of a complicated upper UTI are shown in Box 34.1.</p>

      <p class="box_p">Notes. The list gives some examples but is not aimed to be complete. No widely accepted definition of a complicated urinary tract infection currently exists. Some experts argue that the list above is too long and may result in diagnosing too many patients with a so-called complicated infection. The presence of one or more of these risk factors does not mean that the infection is complicated and in need of a different treatment approach.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_480" title="480" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Upper UTIs occur when pathogens reach the upper urinary tract and overcome the host defences, which leads to tissue damage and an inflammatory response. Pathogens in the urine do not inevitably lead to infection. Infection will depend on the interaction between the pathogen (e.g. the presence of specific virulence factors in the pathogen), the host (who may be more or less likely to have infections because of, for example, underlying diseases) and the local conditions within the urinary tract, for example, because of abnormalities of the urinary tract or the presence of foreign material such as a urinary catheter. Furthermore, it is important to note that urine can also become contaminated during sampling so that the presence of bacteria in a urine sample does not necessarily mean bacteria are present in the urinary tract.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Epidemiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">UTIs are very common worldwide and can affect people at any age. In 2017, there were an estimated 274 million new cases of UTIs globally (upper and lower), combining all ages and both sexes <em>(44)</em>.</p>

    <p>The incidence of UTIs is highest in women and increases with age (e.g. UTIs increase after menopause) and frequency of sexual activity. These infections are particularly common in women because of the anatomy of their lower urinary tract; women have a shorter urethra than men and so microorganisms colonizing the skin of the perineal area can more easily reach the bladder. Risk factors for UTIs include anatomical and functional abnormalities of the urinary tract, such as conditions that predispose to incomplete emptying of the bladder, renal insufficiency and urinary incontinence. Defective host immune factors (e.g. poorly controlled diabetes or neutropenia) and instrumentation of the urinary tract (e.g. urinary catheters and stents) are also predisposing factors.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Most likely pathogens</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Most UTIs are caused by enteric Gram-negative bacteria, most frequently <em>Escherichia coli</em>, which is responsible for about 80% of cases in children and adults. Other causative pathogens are shown in Table 34.1. Data on causative pathogens from low- and middle-income countries are limited.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Classical symptoms of pyelonephritis include flank pain, costovertebral angle tenderness, nausea and vomiting, fever (≥ 38.0 °C) and signs of systemic illness. Symptoms of cystitis (dysuria, suprapubic tenderness, increased urgency and frequency) may or may not be present.</p>

    <p>Severity of signs and symptoms may range from mild disease (e.g. no nausea or vomiting, low-grade fever) that can be safely managed in an outpatient setting with oral antibiotic treatment to severe cases that require hospitalization and intravenous treatment to septic shock requiring admission to intensive care.</p>

    <p>In younger children, symptoms are often non-specific, including high fever, irritability, vomiting and diarrhoea. In children older than 2 years, abdominal pain, urgency, frequency and dysuria are more common.</p>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Patient microbiology tests</h3>

    <p class="noindent">If upper UTI is suspected clinically, a urine culture should be done whenever possible, ideally before starting antibiotic treatment. The rationale is to confirm the diagnosis and to adjust empiric treatment based on susceptibility results.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Urine culture is considered positive when bacteria concentration in the urine is higher than a certain cut-off concentration in symptomatic patients (e.g. ≥ 10<sup>5</sup> microorganisms/mL of urine).</li>

      <li>Minimum cut-offs to diagnose an infection can vary by laboratory.</li>

      <li>Lower cut-offs are often used to diagnose infections in females compared with males or in patients with urinary catheters.</li>

      <ul>
        <li class="box_li">The presence of bacteria in the urine alone is not a sign of infection or an indication for antibiotic treatment. This condition is referred to as asymptomatic bacteriuria when no symptoms suggestive of UTI are present.</li>

    <p class="noindent">In patients with symptoms of a UTI, a urinalysis (dipstick or microscopy) may be done to detect the presence of bacteriuria and/or indirect signs of infection (leukocyturia and nitrites). In a symptomatic patient, leukocyturia (&gt; 10 leukocytes/μL; &gt; 0.01 × 10<sup>9</sup> /L), the presence of leukocyte esterase and/or positive nitrites are indirect signs of infection.</p>

    <p>In patients with a severe clinical presentation and when sepsis of urinary origin is suspected, a white blood cell count may be done to support the diagnosis of bacterial infection as well as testing for biomarkers of infection, such as C-reactive protein.

For example, clinically relevant isolates for this infection would be blood and urine culture data from patients being treated in the hospital with community-acquired upper UTIs.

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Antibiotic treatment</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">The primary goal of empiric antibiotic treatment is to provide effective and timely treatment for the main bacterial pathogens in upper UTI, most commonly <em>Escherichia coli</em>. The choice of empiric treatment should be based on the severity of symptoms (mild/moderate or severe). Many upper UTIs can be managed with oral antibiotics in the outpatient setting <em>(340)</em>.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_486" title="486" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Mild/moderate cases (adults and children)</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Mild/moderate cases of upper UTIs are defined as patients who are not critically ill and there are no clinical signs of sepsis or septic shock. In these cases, for adults, a 7-day treatment course with oral ciprofloxacin should be considered if there is no nausea and vomiting, (Table 34.5). For young children it is clinically more difficult to make a clear distinction between upper and lower UTIs, with fever and general systemic signs of infection seen in both groups. If systemic intravenous treatment is required, a third-generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) is an option. Clinical improvement should be evident within 48–72 hours of starting treatment. If no improvement is seen in that time, a complication (such as an abscess) should be considered and investigated by imaging, and the susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the urine culture should be reviewed.</p>

    <p><strong>Step-down</strong> to oral treatment is based on improvement of symptoms and signs of infection and the ability to take oral antibiotics allowing discharge of the patient home when clinically appropriate.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Severe cases (adults and children)</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Severe cases of upper UTIs are defined as patients who are critically ill, with sepsis and/or septic shock. Please also refer to the chapter on sepsis if suspected. These cases should be treated rapidly with systemic antibiotics. A third-generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) or gentamicin or amikacin (Table 34.5) for 7 days, for both children and adults, is recommended <em>(341,342)</em>. Clinical improvement is usually evident within 48–72 hours of starting treatment when a switch to oral antibiotics should be considered.</p>

    <p><strong>Simplify</strong> empiric treatment to a more narrow-spectrum antibiotic (often also called de-escalation) based on culture results (targeted treatment) or based on rapid clinical improvement when no microbiology test results are available.</p>

    <p><strong>Step-down</strong> to oral treatment is based on improvement of symptoms and signs of infection and the ability to take oral antibiotics allowing discharge of the patient home when clinically appropriate.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Settings with high rates of resistant isolates</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Enterobacterales can develop resistance to antibiotics through different mechanisms, for example, production of ESBL, ampicillinase C (AmpC) beta-lactamases and carbapenemases. Resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics (e.g. in ESBL-producing strains) is often associated with resistance to other classes of antibiotics, such as fluoroquinolones. Although resistance is higher in hospital-acquired strains, it is also present in community-acquired infections. Specific thresholds for when not to use particular antibiotics are given in some guidelines; however, these lack a strong evidence base with no clear rationale for the suggested cut-<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_487" title="487" role="doc-pagebreak"/>offs. Therefore, local knowledge of the prevalence of resistance to antibiotic classes used to treat UTIs should be considered, as well as individual risk factors (e.g. previous infection or colonization with a resistant pathogen) and severity of clinical presentation.</p>

    <p>In hospital settings where resistance to first-choice antibiotics (Table 34.5) is highly prevalent and in severely ill patients with acute clinical deterioration, piperacillin+tazobactam or a carbapenem could be considered, even though the EML and EMLc do not explicitly recommend these options. Empiric use of a Reserve antibiotic could be considered exceptionally in very select cases of seriously ill patients failing to respond to carbapenems or who have previously been treated for infections caused by carbapenem-resistant pathogens or who are known to be colonized with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria known to be susceptible to the selected Reserve antibiotic. Please refer to the chapter on Reserve antibiotic for the definition and list of Reserve antibiotics included in the EML and EMLc.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Definition</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Osteomyelitis is an infection of the bone characterized by inflammation and bone destruction. Infection can be classified according to how the pathogen spreads in the body (via the bloodstream or by local spread from nearby tissue or through direct inoculation, for example in cases of open fractures) or the duration of symptoms (acute or chronic). Acute infections develop and evolve over days or weeks, while chronic infections evolve over months or years. Chronic infections are also characterized by the presence of dead bone fragments (sequestrum).</p>

    <p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_490" title="490" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Both classifications have implications for the management of osteomyelitis. For example, the pathogens infecting bone by local spread are more variable than those infecting bone via the bloodstream. In addition, dead bone, which is usually present in chronic infections, needs to be removed surgically for antibiotic treatment to be successful.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_495" title="495" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Bacteria can reach the bone from a source of infection by spreading through the bloodstream or by local spread or by direct inoculation, for example, after trauma, bone surgery, prosthetic joint implantation, pressure or decubitus ulcers or diabetic foot infections. The infection can affect a single portion of the bone or can extend to the surrounding soft tissue. Infections can rapidly lead to destruction of the affected bone.</p>

    <p>The pathophysiology of osteomyelitis differs between children and adults; osteomyelitis caused by spread through the bloodstream is much more common in children (mostly &lt; 5 years of age) where it usually affects long bones (mostly the tibia and femur) because the bones are more heavily vascularized in children. In adults, spread of the infection via the bloodstream is less common; nonetheless, it can occur (e.g. as a metastatic infection of infective endocarditis) and in most cases if osteomyelitis is caused, it concerns the vertebra and intervertebral disc (vertebral osteomyelitis). However, in the adult population, dissemination by local spread (e.g. after trauma) is far more common.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Epidemiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Risk factors for osteomyelitis are those associated with bacteraemia (e.g. presence of indwelling vascular catheters, injection drug use, haemodialysis) and those making the bone vulnerable to infection, such as bone surgery, open bone fracture, presence of foreign material such as prosthetic joint implants, sickle-cell disease, diabetes and impaired bone vascularization. Acute suppurative and non-suppurative osteomyelitis of the jaw may also result from oral and dental infections.</p>

    <p>Acute osteomyelitis in children is more frequent in low- and middle-income countries and is more common in boys than in girls. If left untreated or managed late, acute osteomyelitis can leave children with long-term disability.</p>

    <p>The global burden of osteomyelitis is still high, mostly in low- and middle-income countries where the disease disproportionately affects the young and where delays in diagnosis and adequate management can lead to acute forms that evolve into chronic osteomyelitis, which is very difficult to treat <em>(348)</em>.</p>

    <p>Most cases globally develop after a traumatic event, for example, infections in open fractures following road traffic incidents or combat. In addition, in high-income settings, diabetes (which can lead to foot osteomyelitis; not specifically addressed in this chapter) and spinal interventions (which can lead to vertebral osteomyelitis) contribute to the burden of disease.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Most likely pathogens</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">The most frequent pathogens associated with acute osteomyelitis in children and adults are shown in Table 35.1 and Table 35.2, respectively.</p>

    </div>

    <p class="noindent">Acute osteomyelitis is characterized by gradual onset of localized pain and/or tenderness with a combination of redness, swelling, pain and warmth of the affected area. Fever (≥ 38.0 °C) and other signs of systemic infection (e.g. tachycardia, leukocytosis) may be present. In the context of osteomyelitis involving the vertebral spine, hip and pelvis, pain is usually the main symptom.</p>

    <p>Osteomyelitis should also be suspected in case of defective healing of a fractured bone.</p>

    <p>In children where acute osteomyelitis often involves the femur and tibia, difficulty and/or inability to walk or reluctance to move the limb may be a presenting symptom.</p>

      <p class="box_p">Osteomyelitis can sometimes present as chronic illness; the patient appears less ill, with fewer marked local signs, and perhaps without a fever. Consider tuberculous osteomyelitis (mostly vertebral also known as Pott disease) when the illness is chronic, discharging sinuses are present (i.e. when a passage (sinus) forms from the infected bone to the surface of the skin and pus drains through) or the patient has other signs of tuberculosis.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Determining the causative pathogen of osteomyelitis is important to target antibiotic treatment because the number of potential causative pathogens is large and antibiotic resistant pathogens (e.g. MRSA) are not infrequent; this makes it difficult to define appropriate empiric treatment. Duration of treatment may be long, thus increasing the risk of side-effects of the antibiotic therapy. Whenever possible, a microbiology sample should therefore be obtained to guide antibiotic treatment (Table 35.3).</p>

    <p>Additional tests that could be considered mostly to help exclude other bone diseases in adults (e.g. metastatic or metabolic bone disease) include calcium, phosphate and alkaline phosphatase. The rationale is that these tests are usually normal in case of osteomyelitis but they are usually abnormal in other bone diseases.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Using microbiology surveillance data</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Routine clinical microbiology surveillance is generally not helpful in informing empiric guidance.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Imaging</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Initial imaging with an X-ray is important when bone infections are suspected. However, a normal X-ray on admission does not rule out acute osteomyelitis but it can help exclude alternative diagnoses, such as a fracture or a malignant condition. In an X-ray, changes such as soft tissue swelling, periosteal thickening and/or elevation and lytic lesions are often found later than clinical disease. An X-ray could also help identify a sequestrum (dead bone) that needs to be removed surgically. Where available, a CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could also be considered in certain patients, for example, in cases of diagnostic uncertainty with X-ray. MRI has a high degree of sensitivity and specificity to detect bone changes, especially in the early phase. Nuclear imaging (e.g. bone scan or bone scintigraphy) could also be considered as an alternative where available.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_502" title="502" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Surgical treatment</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">In adults, no surgical intervention is required in most cases of acute osteomyelitis that are diagnosed and managed early in the course of illness. These cases can be treated with an antibiotic alone with good bone penetration. However, in certain cases of acute osteomyelitis (and always in case of chronic infections), surgical debridement of the bone may be required to reduce the risk of complications because of impaired local vascularization (e.g. avascular necrosis of the bone, permanent bone damage) and to remove “dead” bone and clean the surrounding soft tissue.</p>

    <p>In children, acute osteomyelitis is usually treated with medical management alone (i.e. no surgery).</p>

    <div class="box_amarelo">
      <p class="box_tit"><img src="../Images/notes_icon.jpg" alt="Imagem"/> <strong>Note</strong></p>

      <p class="box_p">For prosthetic joint infections, treatment usually requires the surgical removal of the device. This can be done in one stage (the new prosthesis is immediately inserted) or two stages (the infected prosthesis is removed, the area is debrided, antibiotic treatment is given for several weeks and finally the new prosthesis is inserted). The choice of one stage or two stages depends on the location of the prosthesis (e.g. hip, knee), characteristics of the patient (e.g. advanced age, comorbidities) and local practices.</p>

      <p class="box_p">A detailed discussion of prosthetic-joint infections is beyond the scope of the AWaRe book.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Antibiotic treatment</strong></h2>

    <div class="box_amarelo">
      <p class="box_tit"><img src="../Images/notes_icon.jpg" alt="Imagem"/> <strong>Note</strong></p>

      <p class="box_p">In adults with osteomyelitis, targeted antibiotic treatment based on microbiology is always preferred. In children, it is unusual to identify the pathogen and empiric treatment is usually given.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="noindent">In adults, empiric treatment is sometimes required, for example, in severely ill patients requiring immediate treatment or when it is not possible to obtain a clinical sample for microbiological examination. In these cases, the choice of the antibiotic needs to be based on the pathogens most commonly identified in this type of infections (Table 35.5). In addition, empiric treatment against community-acquired MRSA could be considered in some cases based on individual risk factors (e.g. MRSA colonization) and on the local prevalence of community-acquired MRSA.</p>

    <p>Duration of treatment is usually long (weeks) but it differs in acute or chronic infections. Duration is also influenced by the presence, absence or removal of foreign bodies <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_503" title="503" role="doc-pagebreak"/>(including dead bone), the type of causative organism and its resistance profile, the use of antibiotics with an optimal antibiotic spectrum (i.e. based on microbiology results), and good bone penetration.</p>

    <p>Total treatment duration of about 3 weeks is usually adequate in patients with uncomplicated disease and good clinical recovery, while complicated disease may require 6 weeks of treatment.</p>

    <p>Uncomplicated infections are those with symptoms for &lt; 14 days, no underlying disease, no penetrating trauma and no need for extensive surgical intervention.</p>

    <p>Imaging studies are usually not useful to determine the duration of treatment.</p>

    <p><strong>Simplify</strong> empiric treatment to a more narrow-spectrum antibiotic (often also called de-escalation) based on culture results (targeted treatment) or rapid clinical improvement if culture results unavailable. Historically, the intravenous route has always been preferred, at least in the initial phase of treatment.</p>

    <p><strong>Step down</strong> to oral antibiotics at home is increasingly being used early in the treatment course (e.g. in the first week) when the disease is uncomplicated <em>(349)</em>. Step down to oral treatment is based on improvement of symptoms and signs of infection, improved clinical function and the ability to take oral antibiotics with good bone penetration, especially in adults (e.g. clindamycin).</p>

              <p class="legenda">Notes. All dosages are for normal renal and hepatic function.</p>

              <p class="legenda">As mentioned in the text, empiric treatment should be avoided whenever possible in adults because there are many potential causative pathogens and high levels of resistance (e.g. MRSA) making it difficult to specify appropriate empiric treatment. In children, there is usually less variability in the most likely causative pathogens (in children the disease is mostly caused by spread of <em>Staphylococcus</em> spp. and <em>Streptococcus</em> spp. through the bloodstream) and therefore empiric treatment is common practice.</p>

              <p class="legenda">In neonates, empirical antibiotic therapy should also cover Enterobacterales because infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria can occur in neonates, but <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> remains the most common pathogen. Therefore, in neonates, empiric use of cefotaxime (or ceftriaxone) is appropriate; ceftriaxone should be avoided in infants with hyperbilirubinaemia. In older children, bone infections caused by Enterobacterales are very rare.</p>

              <p class="legenda"><sup>a</sup> If cloxacillin is unavailable, any other IV antistaphylococcal penicillin could be used. For oral administration, dicloxacillin and flucloxacillin are preferred options within the class as they have better oral bioavailability. In adults, a higher dose (e.g. 12 g/day) could be considered given the concerns with bone penetration.</p>

              <p class="legenda"><sup>b</sup> Three weeks of treatment (usually starting with 3–5 days IV treatment and then changing to oral treatment) are now commonly used in children with acute bloodborne osteomyelitis based on response to fever, ability to move the limb and reduction in levels of C-reactive protein (if available).</p>

              <p class="legenda"><sup>c</sup> Longer treatments may be required if implants or foreign material are present or in case of inadequate control at the source of infection; for example, where there is an abscess that has not been adequately drained.</p>

              <p class="legenda"><sup>d</sup> Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime is preferred if invasive non-typhoidal <em>Salmonella</em> or Enterobacterales infection are suspected. In neonates, cefotaxime is recommended in these cases.</p>

              <p class="legenda"><sup>e</sup> Clindamycin is still an acceptable option when community-acquired MRSA is suspected or detected if antimicrobial susceptibility tests show that MRSA is sensitive to clindamycin or in settings where MRSA maintains high levels of susceptibility to clindamycin. Clindamycin can also be used when changing from the IV to the oral route, and in patients allergic to penicillin. In case of MRSA isolates resistant to clindamycin and in settings where the prevalence of community-acquired MRSA is high, the use of vancomycin could be considered when <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> is suspected. Oral options to consider to complete the course of treatment in case of MRSA or methicillin-susceptible <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> infections could be sulfamethoxazole+trimethoprim and doxycycline.</p>

              <p class="legenda"><sup>f</sup> Oral liquid formulations must be refrigerated after reconstitution as clavulanic acid is rapidly metabolized in high ambient temperatures.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Definition</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Septic arthritis is an infection usually of bacterial origin of one or several joints. Infections can be classified based on the causative pathogen (gonococcal or non-gonococcal), on the type of affected joint (large or small joint) and on the concomitant presence or absence of osteomyelitis.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_512" title="512" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">In septic arthritis, bacteria can reach the joint through dissemination through the bloodstream, by local spread or by direct inoculation from a contiguous infected bone or soft tissue, for example, local spread following trauma or bites, bone surgery, prosthetic joint implantation, pressure and decubitus ulcers and diabetic foot infections <em>(350)</em>. Dissemination through the bloodstream is more common in both children and adults. Once bacteria gain access to the joint space, they can adhere to the articular cartilage, produce an inflammatory response and promote cartilage destruction within hours. If left untreated, septic arthritis can rapidly lead to destruction of the cartilage. It therefore needs to be rapidly diagnosed and treated.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Epidemiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Septic arthritis is associated with substantial morbidity (e.g. adverse joint outcomes) and low mortality <em>(350,351)</em>. People at risk of septic arthritis are people with a higher risk of bacteraemia (e.g. those with indwelling vascular catheters, injection drug users, patients on haemodialysis) and those with a higher likelihood of the joint becoming infected, for example, patients with rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, sickle-cell disease and prosthetic joints and other foreign material. Post-surgical infections are common in adults. Community-acquired infections are quite rare in adults, while they are common in children.</p>

    <p>In children, septic arthritis is more frequent in low- and middle-income countries and in boys more than girls. If left untreated or managed late, septic arthritis can leave children with long-term disability.</p>

    <p>Gonococcal arthritis, characterized by dissemination of the infection through the bloodstream, is a rare complication of gonorrhoea that mostly affects women.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Most likely pathogens</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">A large variety of pathogens can cause septic arthritis with some differences between children and adults (Table 36.1 and Table 36.2).</p>

      <p class="box_p">Septic arthritis can occur alone or in combination with osteomyelitis.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="noindent">Septic arthritis is characterized by acute onset (usually a few days, but up to 2 weeks) of joint pain (moderate to severe) and reduced range of motion with redness, swelling and warmth of the joint. The condition may be less evident when “deep” joints such as the hip, shoulder or sacroiliac joint are affected. In most cases, one single joint is affected (often the knee). Involvement of more than one joint (polyarticular infection) is more common with underlying rheumatoid arthritis. Other signs of systemic infection (e.g. fever ≥ 38.0 °C, tachycardia, increased biomarkers of inflammation) are usually present.</p>

    <p>In certain situations (e.g. septic arthritis of multiple joints), it is important to exclude an extra-articular source of infection such as endocarditis.</p>

    <p>In young children permanent destruction of the joint cartilage and long-term disability can occur rapidly, therefore rapid diagnosis and prompt empiric antibiotic treatment are essential.</p>

    <p>In case of gonococcal arthritis, typical signs and symptoms of septic arthritis (mostly affecting one or a few joints and usually the knees and ankles) are usually accompanied by skin manifestations such as rash or small papules on the trunk and distal extremities. Often patients with gonococcal arthritis have no signs or symptoms of cervicitis or urethritis.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Laboratory tests</strong></h2>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Patient microbiology data</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Determining the causative pathogen of septic arthritis is important for targeted antibiotic treatment because the number of potential causative pathogens is large (making it difficult to select empiric treatment) and treatment duration may be long, increasing the risk of side-effects from the antibiotic therapy.</p>

    <p>Whenever possible, a microbiology sample should therefore be obtained to guide antibiotic treatment (Table 36.3). Ideally microbiology test results should be obtained before starting antibiotic treatment. However, because cartilage destruction can occur within hours, tests should never delay the start of antibiotic treatment.</p>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Using microbiology surveillance data</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Due to the wide number of pathogens identified, there is no role for routine surveillance cultures to inform empiric guidance.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_518" title="518" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Imaging</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Initial imaging with an ultrasound is useful when joint infections are suspected to detect joint effusion and synovial swelling due to the presence of increased intra-articular fluid.</p>

    <p>MRI could also be considered, if available, in certain patients particularly when concomitant osteomyelitis is suspected, because MRI is more sensitive and specific than ultrasound in detecting bone changes.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Treatment</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Prompt surgical drainage of any purulent material (aspiration) and washing of the joint (lavage) is a key part of the management of septic arthritis since antibiotics alone are usually not sufficient to control the source of the infection, at least in adults. Aspiration and lavage can reduce the risk of complications, such as permanent cartilage destruction, joint deformity and instability and degenerative arthritis. Immobilization of the joint is not necessary except for pain control.</p>

    <div class="box_amarelo">
      <p class="box_tit"><img src="../Images/notes_icon.jpg" alt="Imagem"/> <strong>Note</strong></p>

      <p class="box_p">For prosthetic-joint infections, treatment can be in one or two stages depending on the location of the prosthesis (e.g. hip, knee), characteristics of the patient (e.g. older age, comorbidities) and on local practices. In the one-stage procedure, the old device is surgically removed and the new prosthesis is immediately inserted. In the two-stage procedure, the infected prosthesis is removed, the area is debrided and antibiotic treatment is given for several weeks. Then, in the second stage, the new prosthesis is inserted.</p>

      <p class="box_p">A detailed discussion of prosthetic-joint infections is beyond the scope of this chapter.</p>

    <div class="box_amarelo">
      <p class="box_tit"><img src="../Images/notes_icon.jpg" alt="Imagem"/> <strong>Note</strong></p>

      <p class="box_p">In adults, targeted antibiotic treatment based on microbiology results is always preferred (unless the patient is severely ill or it is impossible to obtain a clinical sample for microbiological examination) because there are many potential causative pathogens, which makes it difficult to select an appropriate empiric treatment.</p>

      <p class="box_p">In young children, the treatment is often empiric.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="noindent">When patients require empiric treatment (mostly young children or severely ill patients or when it is impossible to obtain a clinical sample for microbiological examination), the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_519" title="519" role="doc-pagebreak"/>choice should be based on the most probable pathogens in this type of infection, mostly <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>and <em>Streptococcus</em> spp. (Table 36.6). In addition, empiric treatment against community-acquired MRSA or <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> may be considered in certain cases based on individual risk factors (e.g. known MRSA colonization) and compatible clinical and epidemiological features.</p>

    <p>The duration of treatment is long – several weeks, except for gonococcal arthritis which requires shorter treatment. Duration of treatment is influenced by: duration of symptoms (acute or chronic); presence, absence or removal of foreign bodies (including devitalized bone if concomitant osteomyelitis is present); type of causative pathogen and its resistance profile; and concomitant presence of osteomyelitis, and therefore the availability of antibiotics with good bone penetration.</p>

    <p>The total treatment duration is generally 3 weeks in children and 4–6 weeks in adults. With gonococcal arthritis, a shorter treatment duration (10–14 days) is adequate.</p>

    <p><strong>Simplify</strong> empiric treatment to a more narrow-spectrum antibiotic (often also called de-escalation) based on culture results (targeted treatment) or rapid clinical improvement if culture results unavailable. Historically, the intravenous route has always been preferred at least in the first week of treatment. However, recent evidence suggests that a change to oral antibiotics in the first week of treatment can be used for patients with uncomplicated disease.</p>

    <p><strong>Step down</strong> to oral treatment is based on improvement of symptoms and signs of infection, improvement in joint function and the ability to take oral antibiotics allowing discharge of the patient home when clinically appropriate.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Definition</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Necrotizing fasciitis is a life-threatening necrotizing infection of the deep soft tissues that specifically affects the muscular fascia – the fascia is the connective tissue surrounding the muscle. The disease is caused mostly by bacteria and is characterized by acute and fulminant (severe and sudden onset) necrosis with tissue destruction and signs of systemic toxicity. Necrotizing fasciitis can be classified based on: the causative pathogen (type 1 or polymicrobial necrotizing fasciitis (caused by multiple pathogens); or type 2 or monomicrobial necrotizing fasciitis (caused by a single pathogen)); the presence or absence of gas in tissues (polymicrobial infections are more often associated with the presence of gas); the site of the infection (e.g. leg, head and neck, perineum); or the risk of a poor outcome (high versus low or moderate risk). Necrotizing fasciitis affecting the perineum is also called Fournier gangrene.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_528" title="528" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">In necrotizing fasciitis, bacteria can reach the muscular fascia by local spread through a skin lesion or a break in the skin barrier (e.g. wounds, bites, injection of drugs, surgery) or through a breach in the mucosal barrier – usually in the intestine where the source could be a diverticulum or a malignancy, or in the oropharynx. Infections can thus be both exogenous (i.e. pathogens that enter the body from the environment) and endogenous (i.e. pathogens that naturally reside in the body). Often a clear place of entry is not identified. Bacteria can also reach the muscular fascia via the bloodstream, although this is less common.</p>

    <p>Necrotizing fasciitis is characterized by tissue damage with necrosis and inflammatory fluid accumulation along the fascia and between muscle groups. The muscle is usually not affected; however, sometimes muscular abscesses can form. Legs and arms are the most commonly affected sites.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Epidemiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare but life-threatening disease. Polymicrobial (type 1) forms occur most frequently in older adults and/or individuals with underlying comorbidities (mostly diabetes <em>(352)</em>, peripheral vascular disease, immunosuppression) or traumatic or surgical wounds. Intravenous drug injection is also a risk factor. Monomicrobial (type 2) forms can occur at any age, including in otherwise healthy individuals, and they are the most common form in children <em>(353)</em>. Toxic shock syndrome is a rare life-threatening complication of necrotizing fasciitis due to toxin production by <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em> (often referred to as group A <em>Streptococcus</em>) or <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and can also be the cause of septic shock when these pathogens are involved.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Most likely pathogens</strong></h2>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Clinical presentation</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Clinical progression to severe disease is rapid. Therefore, the patient should always be carefully monitored for signs of sepsis or septic shock. Please also refer to the chapter on sepsis if suspected.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Adults</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Necrotizing fasciitis is usually characterized by acute onset of pain out of proportion to physical findings in the affected area and rapid onset of systemic signs – for example, fever ≥ 38.0 °C, tachycardia and increased biomarker levels – leukocytosis, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin <em>(354)</em>.</p>

    <p>Signs and symptoms of skin and soft tissue infections (i.e. redness, skin discolouration, swelling, induration (hardening of soft tissue) and warmth of the affected area) are usually present when pathogen entry is through the skin. However, at least initially, the overlying skin often appears only minimally affected and skin changes – typically bullae and necrosis – only become apparent as the infection progresses. Rapid progression of redness, ecchymosis and bullae is also suggestive of this infection.</p>

    <p>In cases of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier gangrene), severe pain is accompanied by signs of necrosis in the perineal area, often the scrotum in men. Rapid progression of the infection to the abdominal wall and gluteal muscles is possible.</p>

    <p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_530" title="530" role="doc-pagebreak"/>While in patients with cellulitis, skin abnormalities are the usual symptoms, in patients with necrotizing fasciitis, severe pain (often disproportionate to skin changes) is the characteristic symptom, at least in the initial phase. A definitive diagnosis requires the direct visualization of necrotic tissue in the muscular fascia through surgical exploration.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Children</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Necrotizing fasciitis is very rare in children but may occur as a complication of varicella (chickenpox) or can be associated with a compromised immune system. Most characteristics described for adults also apply to children, but certain specific features exist <em>(355)</em>. For example, in neonates and infants, the torso is often affected, while in older children the arms and legs and the face are affected.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Laboratory tests</strong></h2>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Patient microbiology tests</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Whenever possible, a microbiology sample of the affected tissue should be obtained to guide antibiotic treatment; samples can be collected at the time of surgical exploration. This will allow the causative pathogen(s) to be determined so that adequate antibiotic treatment can be given, for example, single versus multiple causative pathogens. Blood cultures should also be obtained, ideally before antibiotic treatment is started (Table 37.2).</p>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Using microbiology surveillance data</h3>

    <p class="noindent">There is no role for routine surveillance to inform empiric guidance.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Imaging</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Imaging should not delay surgical exploration (or surgical inspection) since surgery is still the most reliable tool to diagnose and treat necrotizing fasciitis.</p>

    <p>If available, ultrasound imaging may help in the diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis and to evaluate the extent to which the tissue is affected and the presence or absence of gas and fluid along the muscular fascia. A CT scan of the affected area could also be considered.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Management</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Prompt surgical removal of the necrotic tissue through drainage and debridement is the cornerstone of treatment of necrotizing fasciitis. Delays in this step are usually associated with higher mortality <em>(356)</em>. Antibiotic treatment is a complementary measure to adequate surgical source control of the infection.</p>

    <p>Intravenous immunoglobulin is occasionally used when shock is a complication in necrotizing fasciitis and therefore toxic shock syndrome (mostly due to <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em> or <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>) is suspected; however, the effect of the use of high-cost intravenous immunoglobulin on mortality is unclear <em>(357)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Antibiotic treatment</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Because of the seriousness of necrotizing fasciitis and the speed at which it can progress, empiric antibiotic treatment should be given immediately when necrotizing fasciitis is suspected. The antibiotics should cover both Gram-positive bacteria (including methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>) and anaerobic pathogens (Table 37.5).</p>

    <p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_533" title="533" role="doc-pagebreak"/>In patients at higher risk of a Gram-negative bacterial infection (e.g. patients with severe immunosuppression), additional empiric medicines should be considered that have activity against these pathogens.</p>

    <p><strong>Simplify</strong> empiric treatment to a more narrow-spectrum antibiotic (often also called de-escalation) based on culture results (targeted treatment) or rapid clinical improvement if culture results are unavailable.</p>

    <p><strong>Step-down</strong> to oral treatment is based on improvement of symptoms and signs of infection and the ability to take oral antibiotics allowing discharge of the patient home when clinically appropriate.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_539" title="539" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">In pyomyositis, bacteria reach the muscle from another source of infection spread through the bloodstream. Once bacteria reach the muscle, an inflammatory reaction develops with initial swelling of the muscle and progressive abscess formation and increasing oedema. The process may take days to a few weeks for the signs of systemic infection to appear and the presence of a pus collection large enough to be drained to become clinically evident.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Epidemiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Most cases of pyomyositis occur in tropical countries often in young children (&lt; 5 years) or in adults (aged 20–45 years), and males are more affected than females. History of trauma or muscle strain are usually present. HIV infection, malnutrition and malignancies may be risk factors in the tropics, even though most patients are otherwise healthy. In non-tropical countries, the disease is more common in adults with underlying severe medical conditions, such as immunocompromised patients <em>(358)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Clinical presentation</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Pyomyositis is characterized by acute onset (usually days to a few weeks) of localized muscle pain with cramping usually in the lower limbs or in the gluteal muscles (although any muscle can be affected) with a fever ≥ 38.0 °C. Swelling and induration (hardening of soft tissue) of the affected area are also usually present when the disease becomes clinically evident. Other signs of systemic infection (e.g. tachycardia, increased biomarker levels such as leukocytosis, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin) are usually present. Abscess can form within days to weeks. Complications of bacteraemia (e.g. septic emboli, septic arthritis and endocarditis) can occur. The patient should always be monitored for signs of severe clinical progression, such as signs of sepsis or septic shock.</p>

    <p>Please also refer to the chapter on sepsis if suspected.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Most likely pathogens</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Most cases (&gt; 90%) of pyomyositis are caused by <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> including MRSA or by <em>Streptococcus</em> spp. (mostly <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em> often referred to as group A <em>Streptococcus</em>) (Table 38.1). <em>Escherichia coli</em> can sometimes be implicated, especially in patients with cancer. Mycobacteria (<em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> and certain non-tuberculous mycobacteria) can also be responsible for this infection.</p>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Using microbiology surveillance data</h3>

    <p class="noindent">There is no role for routine surveillance to inform empiric guidance.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Imaging</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Initial imaging with an X-ray is important when pyomyositis is suspected to locate the site and extent of the infection, any bony involvement or to exclude an alternative diagnosis. However, if available, MRI or a CT scan could also be considered because they have greater sensitivity (compared to conventional X-ray) in identifying muscle swelling (i.e. inflammation) and the presence of infected tissue.</p>

    <p>Ultrasound is helpful, if available, to detect the presence of an abscess and to guide its drainage.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Management</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Prompt drainage of the abscess (if present) is important for adequate control of the source of infection and is complementary to antibiotic treatment. If extensive muscle necrosis is present or if it is not possible to drain the collection of pus percutaneously, surgery may be necessary.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_542" title="542" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Antibiotic treatment</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Targeted antibiotics based on microbiology tests are preferred in the treatment of pyomyositis. However, when patients require immediate treatment (e.g. are severely ill) or when it is impossible to obtain a clinical sample for microbiological examination, the choice of antibiotic should be based on the pathogens most commonly seen in this type of infection – <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and <em>Streptococcus</em> spp. (Table 38.4). In addition, empiric treatment against community-acquired MRSA may be considered in some cases based on individual risk factors (e.g. known MRSA colonization) and on the local prevalence of community-acquired MRSA. In these cases, some international guidance documents suggest using vancomycin <em>(359)</em>.</p>

    <p>Intravenous antibiotics may be needed, at least in the first phase of treatment.</p>

    <p>Treatment duration is long (usually 2–3 weeks) and is influenced by the clinical and radiological response and by the adequacy of drainage of the abscess, if present. Shorter duration of treatment (2 weeks) could be considered in otherwise healthy patients and when adequate source control is achieved, that is the abscess is well drained. Longer duration (3 weeks) could be considered if source control is inadequate or in patients with underlying diseases.</p>

    <p><strong>Simplify</strong> empiric treatment to a more narrow-spectrum antibiotic (often also called de-escalation) based on culture results (targeted treatment) or rapid clinical improvement if culture results unavailable.</p>

    <p><strong>Step-down</strong> to oral treatment is based on improvement of symptoms and signs of infection and the ability to take oral antibiotics allowing discharge of the patient home when clinically appropriate.</p>

        <li class="box_li">Febrile neutropenia often presents as unexplained fever with no site of infection or pathogen identified.</li>

      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Definition</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Febrile neutropenia is a severe condition that can be caused by common Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, fungi and other opportunistic pathogens. Febrile neutropenia occurs mostly in patients with neoplastic diseases who are receiving cytotoxic myelosuppressive chemotherapy.</p>

    <p>Two elements need to be considered in defining febrile neutropenia: fever and neutropenia.</p>

    <p>For fever, there are no universally accepted temperature cut-offs and slightly different cut-offs are used in different centres. Generally, a pragmatic definition of fever is ≥ 38.0 °C. A more precise definition is used by the Infectious Diseases Society of America in their 2010 <em>Clinical practice guideline for the use of antimicrobial agents in neutropenic patients with cancer (360)</em> which is:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>a single oral temperature measurement of ≥ 38.3 °C or</li>

      <li>a temperature of ≥ 38.0 °C sustained over 1 hour.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_546" title="546" role="doc-pagebreak"/>There is less variation in definition of neutropenia, which is defined as a temporary reduction in the absolute neutrophil count; an absolute neutrophil count of &lt; 1000 (sometimes &lt; 1500) cells/μL (&lt; 1.0 × 10<sup>9</sup> cells/L) is considered indicative of neutropenia. Neutropenia can be classified as severe when the absolute neutrophil count is &lt; 500 cells/μL (&lt; 0.5 × 10<sup>9</sup> cells/L) – also called agranulocytosis – and profound when absolute neutrophil count is &lt; 100 cells/μL (&lt; 0.1 x 10<sup>9</sup> cells/L).</p>

    <p>Febrile neutropenia can be characterized according to identification of the causative pathogen and source of infection as:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>microbiologically proven infection (i.e. the causative pathogen is identified)</li>

      <li>clinical source of infection diagnosed but no pathogen identified (e.g. pharyngitis)</li>

      <li>unexplained fever (no pathogen identified and no clear source of infection)</li>

      <li>non-infectious fever (e.g. medicine-induced).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Unexplained fever with no focus or positive culture is the most common situation observed in clinical practice.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_551" title="551" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Neutropenia (i.e. decreased number of circulating neutrophils) can develop as the result of a reduced production of neutrophils by the bone marrow, or increased peripheral destruction or sequestration at localized inflammatory sites. Once neutrophils fall below a certain threshold, the risk of developing infections increases. Severity and duration of neutropenia are independent risk factors for serious infection, that is, the risk is higher with longer and more severe neutropenia.</p>

    <p>It is beyond the scope of this chapter to describe how cytotoxic chemotherapies and cancer affect the immune system and predispose to infection. As well as a reduced absolute neutrophil count, patients with cancer and on cytotoxic chemotherapy often also have dysfunctional lymphocytes or immunoglobulin deficiencies, impaired natural barriers to infection (e.g. mucositis) and malnutrition, which additionally weaken their ability to control infections. Furthermore, the presence of invasive devices (e.g. intravascular catheters) is an additional risk factor for infection to consider.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Epidemiology</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Neutropenia is the most common complication of cytotoxic cancer treatment that can lead to treatment delays and reductions in the chemotherapy dose <em>(361)</em>. The risk of developing febrile neutropenia depends on: the type of underlying tumour (e.g. very high in patients with acute leukaemia and lower in patients with solid tumours); the type and dose of chemotherapy used; and individual risk factors, such as older age, advanced stage of disease, comorbidities, other concomitant myelotoxic medications <em>(362)</em>. The risk of developing severe infection depends on the duration and severity of neutropenia; therefore, initial risk assessment is an important step to identify patients at low or high risk of developing serious complications, such as complications requiring hospitalization or prolonging hospitalization. As well as the physician’s assessment, several scoring systems exist (e.g. Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) score) to help predict this risk <em>(363)</em>. These systems usually include a combination of factors, such as general clinical status of the patient, presence of comorbidities, age and whether the patient is hospitalized or not. However, no system can distinguish patients at low or high risk of infection with complete accuracy <em>(364)</em>.</p>

    <p>Low-risk patients are those expected to have a shorter duration of severe neutropenia (≤ 7 days) and have no comorbidities (other than cancer) or renal or hepatic dysfunction. High-risk patients are expected to remain neutropenic for longer periods (&gt; 7 days) or are those with ongoing comorbidities (other than cancer) and renal or hepatic dysfunction.</p>

    <p>Neutropenia is also common in children receiving myelosuppressive treatment – especially for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or lymphoma (the most common forms of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_552" title="552" role="doc-pagebreak"/>cancer in childhood <em>(365)</em>) and for acute myeloid leukaemia – or after haemopoietic stem cell transplantation or treatment for certain aggressive solid tumours, such as neuroblastoma <em>(366,367)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Most likely pathogens</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">A fever of infectious origin in a patient with neutropenia is most likely caused by bacteria that colonize the patient’s own skin and bowel, including multidrug-resistant organisms such as ESBL-producing or carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria (Table 39.1). These patients often receive broad-spectrum antibiotics while in hospital and are therefore at increased risk of antibiotic-resistant infections. Furthermore, certain pathogens (e.g. fungi) become more frequent with longer duration of neutropenia.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Clinical presentation</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Apart from fever, other accompanying signs and symptoms of febrile neutropenia vary greatly depending on the underlying infection, for example, pneumonia, UTI, skin infection, meningitis, colitis. Bacteraemia (i.e. the detection of bacteria in blood cultures) may be present. Because patients with neutropenia fail to produce effective inflammatory responses, they can sometimes present with few clinical findings and no fever despite infection.</p>

    <p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_553" title="553" role="doc-pagebreak"/>A detailed clinical examination should always be done to help identify the site of infection. Skin changes (e.g. rash, ulcers, signs of vascular infection), changes in the oral mucosa and pharynx (e.g. ulcers inside the mouth, dental disease, thrush), abnormalities in the perineal and perirectal area, symptoms and signs of typhlitis (inflammation of the cecum) and colitis with abdominal pain, diarrhoea and sometimes rectal bleeding often due to mucositis should therefore always be carefully investigated.</p>

    <p>Clinical progression to severe disease or death can be very rapid (over a few hours); therefore, the presence of any signs of sepsis or septic shock should always be carefully monitored. Please also refer to the chapter on sepsis if suspected.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Laboratory tests</strong></h2>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Patient microbiology tests</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Whenever possible a microbiology sample (e.g. blood cultures) should be obtained – ideally before antibiotic treatment is started – because results of the test can help establish the diagnosis and treatment can be adapted accordingly.</p>

    <p>Tests to consider depend on the most likely primary site of infection and should therefore be adapted based on the clinical presentation (Table 39.2). Some tests should always be performed (indicated as routine tests in Table 39.2), while others could be considered in certain cases, including for surveillance purposes and based on local availability. Additional tests not presented in the table but that could be considered, especially in high-risk patients, include tests to diagnose invasive fungal infections (e.g. <em>Aspergillus</em> galactomannan antigen screening) and those for other viral infections, such as nucleic acid amplification test for cytomegalovirus.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Other tests</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Laboratory tests to consider if febrile neutropenia is suspected depend on the most likely source of infection and are shown in Table 39.3.</p>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Using microbiology surveillance data</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Empiric guidance given by the AWaRe book could be reviewed and adapted based on local clinically relevant microbiology surveillance data. This would include blood culture data from local haemato-oncology patients, ideally risk-stratified by underlying diagnosis.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_557" title="557" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Imaging</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Imaging based on clinical presentation should be considered in the patient’s initial assessment to identify the source of infection. If there is no clinical improvement and the fever does not resolve with treatment in a few days, additional imaging could be considered (e.g. CT scan of the lungs and sinuses, and other tests based on clinical suspicion) to expand diagnostic work-up or to exclude a complicated infection such as invasive fungal disease.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Treatment</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">This chapter focuses on antibiotic treatment of suspected or confirmed bacterial infections but it does not cover antiviral or antifungal treatment. It also does not cover prophylaxis with granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (i.e. growth factors that stimulate the bone marrow to produce more neutrophils) such as filgrastim listed on the EML since 2015 for the treatment of acquired neutropenia.</p>

    <p>The use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors for therapeutic purposes (i.e. in febrile patients) is controversial and guidelines vary in their recommendations. Evidence shows that their use in combination with antibiotics does not reduce mortality compared with antibiotics alone; however, granulocyte colony-stimulating factors could be considered in certain patients because their use is associated with shorter hospital stay and duration of antibiotic use (reduced by 1–2 days) most likely due to the faster neutrophil recovery <em>(371)</em>.</p>

    <p>It is important that source control is achieved as early as possible, this includes drainage of any abscesses and removal or change of invasive devices such as central venous catheters, where appropriate.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Antibiotic treatment</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Patients with neutropenia who develop fever should promptly receive antibiotic treatment even when a clear site of infection is not identified <em>(372)</em>.</p>

    <p>Low-risk patients can be managed in an outpatient setting if adequate monitoring and follow-up are available and if they are able to tolerate oral treatment <em>(373)</em>. High-risk patients, or patients where close follow-up is not feasible, require hospitalization and initial intravenous treatment to start with.</p>

    <p>The choice of empiric treatment should always consider a combination of factors, including the most likely site of primary infection and the infecting pathogens (including risk of viral and invasive fungal infections) and the local pattern of AMR. Other factors, such as known colonization or previous infection with multidrug-resistant organisms and recent <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_558" title="558" role="doc-pagebreak"/>antibiotic exposure (including antibiotic prophylaxis) are also important factors to consider. Recommended empiric antibiotic options are given in Table 39.4.</p>

    <div class="box_amarelo">
      <p class="box_tit"><img src="../Images/notes_icon.jpg" alt="Imagem"/> <strong>Note</strong></p>

      <p class="box_p">Table 39.4 refers to empiric treatment not to treatment escalation in case of persistent fever which is beyond the scope of the chapter.</p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Simplify</strong> empiric treatment to a more narrow-spectrum antibiotic (often also called de-escalation) based on culture results (targeted treatment) or rapid clinical improvement if culture results unavailable.</p>

    <p><strong>Step down</strong> to oral antibiotics is suggested when the patient has made a good clinical response, the fever has settled and the patient can tolerate oral antibiotics.</p>

    <p>Antibiotic treatment for patients with febrile neutropenia may require adjustments in dose and frequency of administration because pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters could be altered in these patients and renal and hepatic toxicity related to chemotherapy is common <em>(374)</em>.</p>

    <p>If the causative pathogen is identified, once susceptibilities are known, antibiotics should be reviewed and modified accordingly. However, even if adequate microbiological sampling is performed, a pathogen is often not identified.</p>

    <p>If fever persists (e.g. patient still has a temperature 48–72 hours after the start of antibiotic treatment) and there is no clinical improvement, further diagnostic tests (e.g. imaging) could be performed to identify the source of infection (if this is still unclear) or to assess whether a local complication has developed such as a fluid collection. In addition, a resistant pathogen or an invasive fungal disease should be considered as they could be responsible for the prolonged fever.</p>

    <p>Duration of treatment will mostly depend on the clinical response (e.g. resolution of fever and clinical recovery) and, if identified, on the infectious site and the causative pathogen.</p>

    <p>Continuation of antibiotic treatment until neutrophil recovery (absolute neutrophil count &gt; 500 cells/μL; &gt; 0.5 × 10<sup>9</sup> cells/L) is controversial with guidelines varying in their recommendations. Evidence suggests that discontinuation of antibiotics based on a positive clinical assessment – for example, if the clinical recovery is good and no source is identified or if an infection has been adequately treated and irrespective of the neutrophil count – can safely reduce exposure to antibiotics <em>(375,376)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Definition of terms used in this chapter</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Definitions are taken from the 2018 WHO publication: <em>Global guidelines for the prevention of surgical site infections (280)</em>.</p>

    <p><strong>Antibiotic prophylaxis</strong>: prevention of infectious complications by administering an effective antimicrobial agent before exposure to contamination during surgery.</p>

    <p><strong>Surgical procedure</strong>: an operation where at least one incision (including laparoscopic incisions) is made through the skin or mucous membrane, or a reoperation through an incision that was left open after a previous operative procedure, and takes place in the operating room.</p>

    <p><strong>Surgical site infection</strong>: an infection that occurs after surgery in the part of the body where the surgery took place. Surgical site infections can sometimes be superficial infections involving the skin only. Other surgical site infections are more serious and can involve tissues under the skin, organs or implanted material.</p>

    <p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_563" title="563" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Surgical site infection is also defined as an infection that occurs up to 30 days after an operation and affects:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the skin and subcutaneous tissue of the surgical incision (superficial incisional); and/or</li>

      <li>the deep soft tissue (for example, fascia or muscle) of the incision (deep incisional) and/or</li>

      <li>any part of the anatomy (e.g. organs and spaces) other than the incision that was opened or manipulated during an operation (organ or space).</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Surgical wound</strong>: a wound created when an incision is made with a scalpel or other sharp cutting device and then closed in the operating room by suture, staple, adhesive tape, or glue and bringing the skin edges together.</p>

    <p><strong>Categories of surgical wound</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>Clean</em>: an uninfected surgical wound in which no inflammation is found, and which is not in the respiratory, alimentary, genital or urinary tracts. In addition, clean wounds are usually closed and, if necessary, drained with closed drainage. Surgical incisional wounds that are done after non-penetrating (blunt) trauma should be included in this category if they meet the criteria.</li>

      <li><em>Clean-contaminated</em>: a surgical wound in the respiratory, alimentary, genital or urinary tracts which was made under controlled conditions and without unusual contamination. Operations involving the biliary tract, appendix, vagina and oropharynx are included in this category, provided no evidence of infection or major (i.e. significant) break in sterile technique is found.</li>

      <li><em>Contaminated</em>: open, fresh, accidental wounds. Also included in this category are: operations with major break in sterile technique (e.g. open cardiac massage) or substantial spillage (of gastrointestinal contents) from the gastrointestinal tract; and incisions in which acute, non-purulent inflammation is found, including necrotic tissue, without evidence of purulent drainage such as dry gangrene.</li>

      <li><em>Dirty or infected</em>: old traumatic wounds with retained dead tissue and those that involve existing clinical infection or perforated viscera. Such wounds suggest that the organisms causing postoperative infection were present at the site of the surgery before the operation.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="noindent">The percentage of surgical site infections varies depending on the type of surgical procedure. For example, in 2017 in 13 European countries reporting data on &gt; 600 000 surgical procedures, the overall percentage of infections per 100 operations ranged from 0.5% after knee prosthesis surgery to 10.1% after colon surgery. For most types of surgery, more than 80% of patients received antibiotic prophylaxis. The only exception was cholecystectomy for which a lower percentage of patients received antibiotic prophylaxis – 44% in case of laparoscopic and 66% in case of open cholecystectomy <em>(377)</em>.</p>

    <p>Another study included data collected in 2016 from more than 12 000 patients from 66 countries with different human development indexes; 10.2% of patients were from countries with a low human development index. Overall, 12.3% of patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery developed a surgical site infection within 30 days. However, statistically significant differences in the incidence of surgical site infections were found based on the human development indexes. In particular, the incidence of surgical site infections was 9.4% in countries with a high human development index, 14.0% in countries with a medium human development index and 23.2% in those with a low human development index. Patients in countries with a low human development index were 1.6 times more likely to develop an infection than patients in countries with a higher human development index <em>(378)</em>. Variation in infection rates was also found after caesarean sections with rates of infections ranging from 3% to 11% in high-income countries compared to 3% to 24% in low- and middle-income countries <em>(379)</em>.</p>

    <p>Surgical site infections and surgical prophylaxis to prevent them are a frequent cause of antibiotic use in hospitals. The 2015 global point prevalence survey on antibiotic use (reporting data from 303 hospitals in 53 countries) reported that on the day of the survey, 1.6% of admitted patients were receiving antibiotics for a postoperative surgical site infection <em>(291)</em>. Of note, 34.4% of adult inpatients were receiving at least one antibiotic on the day of the survey. Of the total antibiotic prescriptions, 17.8% were for surgical prophylaxis. The most frequently prescribed antibiotic was cefazolin, prescribed in 27.5% of patients receiving surgical prophylaxis. Prolonged surgical prophylaxis (&gt; 1 day) was common in all regions, ranging from 40.6% in Oceania to 86.3% in eastern Europe <em>(291)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Antibiotic prophylaxis</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">The choice of the antibiotic should be based on the type of surgical procedure because not all procedures are associated with the same risk of developing infection (Table 40.2).</p>

    <p>In general, antibiotic prophylaxis before surgery where the most likely pathogens causing infection are Gram-positive bacteria should consist of intravenous first- or second-<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_571" title="571" role="doc-pagebreak"/>generation cephalosporins – cefazolin or, as an alternative second choice, cefuroxime. These surgeries include clean procedures such as cardiac and vascular surgery but also procedures that involve the placement of a prosthesis or implant.</p>

    <p>If additional pathogens (e.g. anaerobes) could cause infection (e.g. in abdominal procedures), antibiotic prophylaxis should be adapted accordingly. In these cases, cefazolin in combination with metronidazole would be an appropriate option.</p>

    <p>In patients known to be colonized with MRSA and who will have a skin incision, vancomycin prophylaxis (in addition to the routine recommended antibiotic prophylaxis) may be justified. This is recommended because vancomycin alone is less effective than cefazolin (the antibiotic recommended as prophylaxis in most surgical procedures) against methicillin-sensitive <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and because vancomycin has no activity against Gram-negative bacteria. It should be noted that in patients colonized with MRSA, procedure-specific preventive measures other than antibiotic prophylaxis (e.g. nasal decolonization with mupirocin ointment, skin antisepsis) may be beneficial but such measures are not specifically addressed in this chapter. Please refer to the WHO guidelines for the prevention of surgical site infections <em>(280)</em> for information on such preventive measures.</p>

    <p>In the context of patients known to be colonized with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (e.g. bacteria producing ESBLs or carbapenemases), the WHO guidelines acknowledged a lack of high quality evidence to make recommendations on the need to include other antibiotics for prophylaxis to cover these pathogens <em>(280)</em>. However, certain factors, such as the closeness of the likely reservoir of these bacteria to the operative site or characteristics of the patient, could help to make decision on a case-by-case basis.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Timing of antibiotic prophylaxis before surgery</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">According to the previously cited WHO guidelines, the antibiotic should be given 120 minutes or less before incision <em>(280)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Duration of antibiotic prophylaxis</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent"><strong>Antibiotic prophylaxis should not be continued after surgery</strong> for the purpose of preventing surgical site infections including in the presence of a surgical wound drain <em>(280)</em>. This is because one dose of the prophylactic antibiotic should cover the entire period of potential contamination (i.e. from the time of the incision until final closure of the wound) in most cases and continuing prophylaxis does not offer additional benefit in reducing the incidence of surgical site infections compared with discontinuing it <em>(381)</em>. At the same time, limiting the duration to one single dose reduces the risk of selecting resistant bacteria in the patient’s own microbiota and the risk of developing <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> infections.</p>

    <p>Only in certain cases may a further dose of antibiotic be required, such as for prolonged surgical procedures (exceeding about two times the half-life of the antibiotic) or when there is major blood loss <em>(380)</em>. If another dose is necessary, the half-life of the antibiotic should be considered, for example, giving a second dose of cefazolin 4 hours after the initial preoperative dose in long surgeries (Table 40.3).</p>

    <p class="noindent">The Reserve group of antibiotics includes antibiotics that still have relevant levels of activity against some of the multidrug-resistant bacteria listed in the WHO priority pathogen list, including bacteria which are resistant to most or all of the EML antibiotics in the Access and Watch groups (Table 41.1).</p>

    <p>In addition, all Reserve antibiotics are categorized as either high priority or highest priority in the WHO list of critically important antimicrobials for human medicine <em>(382)</em>. This list is intended for public health and animal health authorities who should ensure that critically important antibiotics for humans are also used sensibly in veterinary medicine. Use of any Reserve antibiotics in animals should be avoided wherever possible.</p>

    <p>Reserve antibiotics can either be older off-patent antibiotics that have been reintroduced into clinical practice (e.g. polymyxin B, colistin, fosfomycin) or new antibiotics that have been recently licensed for the treatment of multidrug-resistant bacteria. It is important to note that not all antibiotics that have activity against strains of multidrug-resistant bacteria have been included in the EML <em>(8)</em>. Between 2017 and 2021, the list of Reserve antibiotics was updated and some antibiotics were removed and others added to this group. Only antibiotics listed on the EML and EMLc are considered essential for all health systems.</p>

    <p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_578" title="578" role="doc-pagebreak"/>The EML needs to be continually updated as more evidence on the antibiotics in the list and new antibiotics become available. The list of Reserve antibiotics in the 2021 EML is closely aligned with the WHO analysis of the clinical antibacterial pipeline <em>(383)</em>, which assesses how antibacterial drugs in the development pipeline address the WHO priority pathogens list. Ideally an antibiotic under development will progress through the pipeline and, after licensing, would be considered for listing in the EML as a Reserve antibiotic.</p>

    <p>The overarching principle for listing an antibiotic as a Reserve antibiotic in the EML is evidence of its usefulness to effectively treat a severe clinical infection for which the currently available treatment options are very limited, indicating a clear unmet global public health need. Other important considerations are strong evidence that the antibiotic has: better efficacy, safety and durability (low likelihood of selection of resistance on treatment) than comparable medicines; low impact on the microbiome; and simplicity of administration. There is therefore likely to be a range of Reserve antibiotics that cover different serious clinical infections. These antibiotics would include, for example, systemic antibiotics targeted at particular multidrug-resistant phenotypes (e.g. carbapenem-resistant organisms) or targeted at important pathogens (e.g. <em>Pseudomonas</em> spp. or <em>Acinetobacter</em> spp.). Equally, there is an important unmet clinical need for active oral drugs that can be used as targeted treatment of multidrug-resistant pathogens (e.g. <em>Klebsiella</em> spp.). This focus on public health emphasizes the importance for Reserve antibiotics to have phenotypic and genotypic activity that is globally relevant. For example, Reserve antibiotics that are active against carbapenem-resistant pathogens should ideally also have activity against the most common genetic types identified in low- and middle-income countries, e.g. metallo-beta-lactamases.</p>

    <p>Reserve antibiotics are considered the so-called last-resort antibiotics which are still effective for the treatment of specific patient populations. There is a complex balance between using Reserve antibiotics effectively in sick patients where needed and their overuse potentially leading to a rapid decline in their effectiveness. The great majority of Reserve antibiotics are intravenous and used in the hospital facility setting. There is wider use of Reserve antibiotics in high-income countries than in low- and middle-income countries, raising concerns about equity of access to Reserve antibiotics which are generally more expensive than Access or Watch antibiotics.</p>

    <p>Therefore, these antibiotics should be available for clinical care when needed but used only in certain situations where their use is likely to have clear clinical benefits. Reserve antibiotics are ideally used for <strong>targeted</strong> treatment once multidrug-resistant bacteria are confirmed; for example, following laboratory identification of the pathogen from a blood culture and susceptibility testing demonstrating wide multidrug resistance but sensitivity to a Reserve antibiotic. However, high quality rapid culture and sensitivity data are often not available in many settings and identification of a pathogen may not always be feasible even with access to state-of-the-art microbiologic techniques. The AWaRe book focuses on empiric treatment when diagnostic test results, including microbiological cultures, are not available. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_579" title="579" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Reserve antibiotics could be considered for empiric therapy in very select cases where a multidrug-resistant pathogen as the cause of the infection can be strongly suspected based on the clinical infection, local microbiology, previous treatment or known colonization with a multidrug-resistant pathogen.</p>

    <p>Reserve antibiotics are not listed as first- or second-choice options for any of the infections included in the AWaRe book. However, to help with the appropriate use of Reserve antibiotics, a comment about their potential role for empiric therapy has been added to specific chapters where they are most likely to be used, for example, for severe hospital-acquired infections or severe infections in patients who have received multiple antibiotic treatments in the recent past. The risks and benefits of treatment need to be carefully considered in high-risk patient populations with multidrug-resistant infections that have a high associated mortality. Some antibiotics on the Reserve list have substantial toxicity but may still be used for treatment if there are no or few other treatment options and the risk of death or permanent sequelae due to the infection are high. Ensuring the optimal use of Reserve antibiotics is complex and difficult at both a patient and country level, but control of the use of Reserve antibiotics is critical to maintaining their future effectiveness. For example, colistin in South Africa is only authorized for use if specific criteria are met and with approval from the Medicines Control Council, as in section 21 of the Medicines and Related Substances Act 101 of 1965 <em>(384)</em>.</p>

    <p>The need for stewardship of Reserve antibiotics and what countries should do to contribute to good stewardship are outlined in Box 41.1.</p>

    <div class="box_azul">
      <p class="box_tit"><strong><a id="Box41.1"/>Box 41.1 – Reserve antibiotic stewardship</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li class="box_li">Preserving the effectiveness of Reserve antibiotics (i.e. preventing the development of resistance to these antibiotics in the future) is key to maintaining their longevity in clinical use.</li>

        <li class="box_li">Therefore, all efforts should be made to ensure careful use of Reserve antibiotics within local and national stewardship strategies, which should include routine local and/or national monitoring and reporting of their use.</li>

        <li class="box_li">Countries should consider developing formal guidance on and control of the use of Reserve antibiotics at a national and local level, including through medicines regulation.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>Prescribers need to recognize the very limited data available on the clinical efficacy of most Reserve antibiotics in treating multidrug-resistant infections. Regulatory approval is usually obtained through non-inferiority trials (usually trials on complicated UTI and/or complicated intraabdominal infections) containing few high-risk patients with multidrug-resistant infections. Vulnerable patient populations at particular risk for infections by multidrug-resistant pathogens such as the very young, the very old and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_580" title="580" role="doc-pagebreak"/>immunocompromised individuals are often underrepresented in these trials. Therefore, the effectiveness of these new molecules on multidrug-resistant isolates is often based on in vitro data or case reports and retrospective observational studies with a high inherent risk of bias. Furthermore, recruitment of patients with carbapenem-resistant pathogens into pathogen-focused or limited-population trials has been difficult, which has led to estimates of clinical efficacy based on small studies. Strategic comparative public health-focused (rather than regulatory) trials for multidrug-resistant infections that directly compare multiple agents in high-risk populations for clinical efficacy, toxicity, resistance and health economic outcomes are urgently needed to inform the serious unmet public health priorities in this critical area.</p>

        <li class="box_li">The primary use of cefiderocol is for the treatment of infections caused by metallo-beta-lactamases (MBL)-producing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales.</li>

        <li class="box_li">There is very limited evidence for the use of cefiderocol in children.</li>

      </ul>
    </div>

    <p class="noindent">Cefiderocol is the first clinically available siderophore cephalosporin. Siderophore-antibiotic conjugates exploit the ability of siderophores to bind extracellular free iron and use iron transporters to cross bacterial cell membranes (in the case of cefiderocol the outer membrane of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria), which results in active accumulation of the antibiotic at the site of action. In addition, cefiderocol can also enter the bacterial cell by passively diffusing through porin channels similar to other beta-lactams.</p>

    <p>Cefiderocol has been licensed for the treatment of complicated UTIs, hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia in patients 18 years or older. Its indications include severe infections caused by certain strains of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> and <em>Acinetobacter baumannii</em> depending on the type of carbapenemase produced and the resistance mechanism in patients with limited treatment options.</p>

    <p>The primary use of cefiderocol is for the treatment of infections caused by metallo-beta-lactamases-producing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales for which alternative treatment options are very limited (at the time of publication of the AWaRe book).</p>

    <p>Particular caution is needed in patients with <em>Acinetobacter baumannii</em> infections because of concerning data from a randomized clinical trial that reported higher mortality with cefiderocol in this patient population <em>(385,386)</em>.</p>

    <p>Its current indications in the EML and EMLc <em>(8,9)</em> include infections caused by certain strains of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> depending on the type of carbapenemase produced and the resistance mechanism.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Cefiderocol is currently available as powder for intravenous infusion (1 g/vial). It is administered by intravenous infusion over 3 hours.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Mechanism of action</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Cefiderocol acts by inhibiting bacterial enzymes responsible for cell-wall synthesis, primarily penicillin-binding proteins. This leads to cell lysis and death.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Spectrum of activity</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Cefiderocol is only active against aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (Table 42.1). Specifically, it is active against many carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> and <em>Acinetobacter baumannii</em> clinical isolates. Cefiderocol has no, or only limited, activity against Gram-positive bacteria or anaerobes.</p>

    <p>In vitro, cefiderocol is not degraded by ESBL and by certain types of carbapenemase, in particular <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> carbapenemases, oxacillinase-48 (OXA-48) beta-lactamases and metallo-beta-lactamases such as New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamases, Verona integron-encoded, or imipenemase metallo-beta-lactamases.</p>

    <p>Of note, cefiderocol is one of the few Reserve antibiotics with reported activity against metallo-beta-lactamases. The other such antibiotics are colistin/polymyxin B, fosfomycin and aztreonam combined with avibactam, in the form of ceftazidime+avibactam.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Clinical efficacy</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">At the time of publication of the AWaRe book, three randomized clinical trials had assessed the efficacy and safety of cefiderocol in adults <em>(385,387,388)</em>. The results of these trials provide evidence that cefiderocol is not inferior to carbapenems for the treatment of infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria (not specifically multidrug-resistant) particularly for complicated UTIs, HAP including VAP and bloodstream infections or sepsis.</p>

    <p>One study that enrolled 150 patients with confirmed carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative infection and compared cefiderocol to the best available therapy reported higher mortality in the cefiderocol group, which appeared to be driven by a worse outcome in the subgroup of patients with <em>Acinetobacter baumannii</em> infections <em>(385)</em>. Mortality at day 28 was 24.8% (25/101) in the cefiderocol group versus 18.4% (9/49) in the best available therapy group (difference 6.4%, 95% confidence interval (CI): −8.6% to 19.2%). The statistically significant difference persisted at day 49: 34/101 (33.7%) in the cefiderocol group versus 10/49 (20.4%) in the best available therapy group; difference 13.3%, 95% CI: −2.5% to 26.9%.</p>

    <p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_586" title="586" role="doc-pagebreak"/>A possible explanation given by the authors for this difference was that, despite randomization, a higher mortality risk was present at the time of randomization in the cefiderocol group; for example, more patients were in the intensive care unit or had experienced shock in the month preceding randomization. The increase in mortality remains, however, a major concern in this patient population and requires further investigation in clinical trials.</p>

    <p>Although very small numbers of patients with metallo-beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales were included in these trials, outcomes in this group of patients were favourable.</p>

    <p>At the time of publication of the AWaRe book, cefiderocol is being assessed in phase II trials (i.e. trials that assess safety and effectiveness in small groups of patients) in children and good evidence about its efficacy and safety in the paediatric setting is lacking.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Toxicity</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Cefiderocol has a good safety profile similar to other beta-lactams and is well tolerated. In clinical trials, side-effects were described in proportions similar to those experienced by patients in control groups. Gastrointestinal effects (e.g. diarrhoea) are the most commonly reported side-effects.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Dose</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Cefiderocol requires dose adjustments in cases of renal impairment (Table 42.2). Renal function should be closely monitored and doses adjusted accordingly. Dose adjustments are not covered in the AWaRe book. Please also refer to the chapter on dosing for more information.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Indication for the use as a Reserve antibiotic</strong></h2>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Targeted treatment</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Cefiderocol could be considered as a last-resort option for the targeted treatment of severe invasive infections (e.g. positive blood culture) caused by laboratory-confirmed <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_587" title="587" role="doc-pagebreak"/>carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, particularly if the resistance is caused by metallo-beta-lactamases. The use of cefiderocol should be limited to situations where no other adequate therapeutic options are available. Given the increased mortality observed in the trial mentioned before <em>(385)</em>, cefiderocol should be used with caution in patients with <em>Acinetobacter baumannii</em>infection.</p>

    <p>To preserve its effectiveness (i.e. to prevent the development of resistance), cefiderocol should not be used to treat infections caused by isolates only producing ESBLs when there are other options available.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Empiric treatment</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Cefiderocol could be considered for empiric use exceptionally in very select cases of seriously ill patients with invasive infections (e.g. patients with sepsis/septic shock) including the following patients.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Patients who have not responded to carbapenems if: (i) other causes of treatment failure have been excluded first, and (ii) there is a strong suspicion that the infection is caused by carbapenem-resistant bacteria, especially in settings with a high prevalence of metallo-beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales. However, if a patient is not improving, antibiotic failure is not the only possible cause to consider. Alternative reasons include: alternative diagnosis; development of complications (e.g. an abscess); inadequate control of the source of infection; suboptimal dose of the antibiotic; or impossibility for the antibiotic to reach an adequate concentration at the site of infection. These possible causes of the lack of improvement in a patient are always important to consider before changing or adding new antibiotics.</li>

      <li>Patients who have previously been treated for infections caused by carbapenem-resistant bacteria that are susceptible only to cefiderocol.</li>

      <li>Patients who are known to be colonized with carbapenem-resistant bacteria found to be susceptible only to cefiderocol.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To help prescribers identify clinical scenarios where empiric use of Reserve antibiotics could exceptionally be considered, suggestions are given in the relevant chapters of the AWaRe book for certain infections – only for infections where empiric use could potentially be adequate on a case-by-case basis.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_588" title="588" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Emerging resistance in Enterobacterales, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>and <em>Acinetobacter baumannii</em></strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Most Gram-negative bacteria are susceptible to cefiderocol. However, at the time of publication of the AWaRe book, few data were available about resistance. Most evidence comes from two laboratory surveillance studies that tested the in vitro activity of cefiderocol in more than 30 000 Gram-negative aerobic isolates (years 2014–2017) and showed that cefiderocol was effective at low minimum inhibitory concentrations for more than 99% of isolates <em>(389,390)</em>. An increase in minimum inhibitory concentrations to cefiderocol has emerged on treatment in a small proportion of patients in trials.</p>

    <p>Data on resistance to cefiderocol are currently not reported by the GLASS.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Duration</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Treatment duration varies according to indication and should be as short as possible, usually between 7 and 14 days.</p>

      </ul>
    </div>

    <p class="noindent">Ceftazidime+avibactam is a combination of a third-generation cephalosporin (ceftazidime) in clinical use since the 1980s and a new non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor (avibactam). Its current indications in the EML and EMLc <em>(8,9)</em> include infections caused by certain strains of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> depending on the type of carbapenemase produced and the resistance mechanism. Its activity against <em>Acinetobacter baumannii</em> is limited.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Administration</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Ceftazidime+avibactam is currently available as powder for intravenous infusion (2 g + 0.5 g in vial). It is administered by intravenous infusion over 2 hours.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Mechanism of action</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Ceftazidime acts by inhibiting bacterial enzymes responsible for cell-wall synthesis, primarily penicillin binding protein 3. Avibactam targets the site of certain serine beta-lactamases and inactivates them, thus protecting ceftazidime from degradation.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Ceftazidime+avibactam is mainly active against aerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Specifically, it is active against ceftazidime-resistant and many carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> clinical isolates, but its activity against <em>Acinetobacter</em> spp. is limited.</p>

    <p>Avibactam inhibits the activity of ESBLs, AmpC beta-lactamases, <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> carbapenemases and OXA-48 beta-lactamases (Table 43.1), and so preserves the activity of ceftazidime against many multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. However, avibactam does not inhibit the activity of metallo-beta-lactamases such as New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase, Verona integron-encoded, or imipenemase metallo-beta-lactamases and therefore ceftazidime is inactive against strains expressing these beta-lactamases.</p>

    <p>Ceftazidime+avibactam also has some antistreptococcal activity, very limited antistaphylococcal activity and no antienterococcal activity. Its activity against anaerobes varies: <em>Clostridium</em> spp. are resistant and <em>Bacteroides</em> spp. show unpredictable susceptibility.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Clinical efficacy</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Several clinical trials have assessed the efficacy and safety of ceftazidime+avibactam in adults and provide evidence that it is not inferior to carbapenems for the treatment of infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria particularly for: complicated UTIs <em>(391,392)</em>; complicated intra-abdominal infections in combination with metronidazole <em>(392–394)</em>; and HAP <em>(395)</em>. Of note, in the majority of trials, the infection being caused by multidrug-resistant organisms was not an inclusion criterion. In children, at the time of publication of the AWaRe book, ceftazidime+avibactam has been assessed in phase II trials (i.e. trials that assess safety and effectiveness in small groups of patients) for the treatment of complicated UTIs, compared with cefepime <em>(396)</em>, and in combination with metronidazole for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections, compared with meropenem <em>(397)</em>.</p>

    <p>In both studies, ceftazidime+avibactam was well tolerated with a safety profile similar to that of ceftazidime alone and appeared effective in children with complicated urinary or intra-abdominal infections caused by Gram-negative pathogens.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Toxicity</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Ceftazidime+avibactam is well tolerated and has side-effects similar to those previously reported for ceftazidime alone. The most frequent side-effects are diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Dose</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Ceftazidime+avibactam requires dose adjustments in cases of renal impairment (Table 43.2). Renal function should be closely monitored, and doses adjusted accordingly. Please also refer to the chapter on dosing for more information.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Indication for use as a Reserve antibiotic</strong></h2>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Targeted treatment</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Ceftazidime+avibactam could be considered as a last-resort option for the targeted treatment of severe invasive infections (e.g. septic shock with positive blood culture) caused by laboratory-confirmed carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales or <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> (not <em>Acinetobacter baumannii</em>), including infections caused by strains producing certain carbapenemases that have tested susceptible to this antibiotic.</p>

    <p>Ceftazidime+avibactam is not indicated for infections caused by strains producing metallo-beta-lactamases. Sometimes ceftazidime+avibactam is combined with aztreonam for these strains but the evidence remains limited.</p>

    <p>If ceftazidime+avibactam is used to treat intra-abdominal infections, it should be used as part of a combination treatment because it lacks activity against anaerobic organisms – therefore it is usually used in combination with metronidazole.</p>

    <p>To preserve its effectiveness (i.e. to prevent the development of resistance), ceftazidime+avibactam should not be used to treat infections caused by isolates only producing ESBLs or by ceftazidime-resistant bacteria when there are other options available.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Empiric treatment</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Ceftazidime+avibactam could be considered for empiric use exceptionally in very select cases of seriously ill patients with invasive infections (e.g. patients with sepsis/septic shock without microbiological test results) suspected to be caused by a multidrug-resistant pathogen (e.g. severe hospital-acquired infections or infections in patients who have received multiple antibiotic treatments in the recent past), such as in the following situations.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Patients who have not responded to carbapenems if other causes of treatment failure have been excluded first and there is a strong suspicion that the infection <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_594" title="594" role="doc-pagebreak"/>is caused by carbapenem-resistant bacteria. Since ceftazidime+avibactam is not active against metallo-beta-lactamases conveying carbapenem resistance, it is important to know the most prevalent genotypic variants that are circulating of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria in the setting where the patient acquired the infection. However, if a patient is not improving, antibiotic failure is not the only possible cause to consider. Alternative reasons include, for example: alternative diagnosis; development of complications (e.g. an abscess); inadequate source control; sub-optimal dose of the antibiotic; or impossibility for the antibiotic to reach an adequate concentration at the site of infection. Alternative reasons are always important to consider before changing or adding new antibiotics.</li>

      <li>Patients who have previously been treated for infections caused by carbapenem-resistant bacteria.</li>

      <li>Patients who are known to be colonized with carbapenem-resistant bacteria found to be susceptible to ceftazidime+avibactam.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="noindent">To help prescribers identify clinical situations where empiric use of Reserve antibiotics could exceptionally be considered, suggestions are given in the relevant chapters of the AWaRe book for selected infections (only for infections where empiric use could potentially be adequate on a case-by-case basis).</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Emerging resistance in Enterobacterales and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em></strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Most <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> are still susceptible to ceftazidime+avibactam. The proportion of isolates resistant to ceftazidime+avibactam is low (higher for <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>) with variability across geographical regions <em>(398,399)</em>. Data on resistance to ceftazidime+avibactam are currently not reported by the GLASS. Resistance is often associated with previous exposure to ceftazidime+avibactam <em>(400)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Duration</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Treatment duration varies according to indication and should be as short as possible, usually between 7 and 14 days.</p>

        <li class="box_li">Fosfomycin has activity against methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and many carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales.</li>

        <li class="box_li">Fosfomycin is usually used as part of combination treatments because of concerns about the emergence of resistance.</li>

        <li class="box_li">There is very limited evidence on the use of fosfomycin in children.</li>

      </ul>
    </div>

    <p class="noindent">Fosfomycin is an antibiotic belonging to the class of phosphonic antibiotics discovered at the end of the 1960s. Its current indications in the EML and EMLc include infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales <em>(8,9)</em>. For <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, the activity of fosfomycin is variable.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Administration</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Fosfomycin is available as powder for intravenous infusion (2 g; 4 g (as sodium) in vial). Fosfomycin has to be administered by slow intravenous infusion. Intramuscular use is discouraged by the European Medicines Agency because of insufficient data confirming benefits to patients <em>(401)</em>. Oral formulations (fosfomycin trometamol and fosfomycin calcium) mostly used for the treatment of lower UTIs are not currently included in the EML and EMLc <em>(8,9)</em> and therefore they are not covered in this chapter.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Mechanism of action</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Fosfomycin acts by inhibiting bacterial enzymes responsible for cell-wall synthesis, primarily pyruvyl transferase, an enzyme necessary for the synthesis of peptidoglycan.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_597" title="597" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Spectrum of activity</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Fosfomycin is active against several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria but not as a single agent against <em>Streptococcus</em> spp., or <em>Acinetobacter</em> spp. or anaerobic bacteria. Specifically, it is usually active against <em>Enterococcus</em> spp. (including vancomycin-resistant strains), <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (including methicillin-resistant strains) and <em>Staphylococcus epidermidis</em>. It is also active against Gram-negative Enterobacterales (including ESBL-producing strains); however, activity against carbapenem-resistant or carbapenemases-producing strains is variable (Table 44.1). Fosfomycin’s activity against <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> is variable.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_598" title="598" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Clinical efficacy</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Intravenous fosfomycin could be considered for the treatment of certain severe infections when other antibiotics cannot be used or are not effective. It is usually used as part of combination treatments, mostly because of concerns about the emergence of resistance when used alone. The benefits of combination treatment compared with monotherapy in terms of better clinical efficacy are unclear as there is limited clinical evidence <em>(402,403)</em>.</p>

    <p>Few clinical trials have assessed the efficacy and safety of fosfomycin (intravenous) in adults. Fosfomycin has been assessed for the treatment of complicated UTIs and the results showed that fosfomycin was not inferior to piperacillin+tazobactam <em>(404)</em>. Another non-inferiority trial which compared fosfomycin with meropenem and ceftriaxone has recently been completed <em>(405)</em>. Fosfomycin has also been evaluated for the treatment of MRSA bacteraemia and endocarditis in combination with daptomycin and this combination was more effective than daptomycin alone <em>(406)</em>.</p>

    <p>Other evidence in support of the use of fosfomycin for difficult-to-treat <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> infections (including MRSA) exists but it is anecdotal and inconclusive. This evidence is mostly from observational and in-vitro studies, including results from a clinical trial comparing fosfomycin (in combination with imipenem) to vancomycin alone for the treatment of complicated MRSA bacteraemia and endocarditis; however, this study failed to reach an adequate sample size <em>(407)</em>.</p>

    <p>In children, the evidence is even more limited. One pharmacokinetic and safety trial has recently been completed of fosfomycin as an empiric treatment in neonatal sepsis <em>(408)</em>.</p>

    <p>The use of fosfomycin for other indications (e.g. bone and joint infections, hospital-acquired pneumonia, meningitis and abdominal infections) relies on evidence from case reports or other observational and in vitro studies which is therefore less robust.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Toxicity</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Fosfomycin is well tolerated. However, use of the intravenous formulation can be associated with sodium overload related to the sodium salt formulation (this could be of concern in patients with heart failure) and hypokalaemia (therefore potassium levels should be regularly monitored).</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Dose</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">The optimal intravenous dose still needs to be clearly defined (Table 44.2). Usually, doses vary with the severity of the disease and the patient’s renal function. Dose adjustments are necessary in cases of renal impairment. Please also refer to the chapter on dosing for more information.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Indication for use as a Reserve antibiotic</strong></h2>

    <h3 class="h3a sigil_not_in_toc">Targeted treatment</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Fosfomycin (usually as part of combination therapy to reduce the risk of the development of resistance) could be considered in the following cases.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>As a last-resort option for the targeted treatment of severe infections caused by laboratory-confirmed carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales or <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> (including strains producing carbapenemases) that have been shown to be susceptible to this antibiotic. Caution is needed with infections caused by <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> because the activity of fosfomycin against this pathogen is variable.</li>

      <li>As a last-resort option for difficult-to-treat infections caused by <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (including MRSA) and <em>Enterococcus</em> spp., including vancomycin-resistant strains. However, the 2021 version of the EML and EMLc does not include this use.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Empiric treatment</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Usually as part of combination therapy, fosfomycin could be considered for empiric use in selected cases of seriously ill patients with invasive infections (e.g. patients with sepsis/septic shock) suspected to be caused by a multidrug-resistant pathogen (e.g. severe hospital-acquired infections or infections in patients who have received multiple antibiotic treatments in the recent past) such as in the following situations.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Patients who have not responded to carbapenems if other causes of treatment failure have been excluded first and there is a strong suspicion that the infection is caused by a carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales – fosfomycin does not reliably treat <em>Acinetobacter</em> spp. and its activity against <em>Pseudomonas</em> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_600" title="600" role="doc-pagebreak"/><em>aeruginosa</em>is variable. However, if a patient is not improving, antibiotic failure is not the only possible cause to consider. Alternative reasons include, for example: alternative diagnosis, development of complications (e.g. an abscess), inadequate source control, sub-optimal dose of the antibiotic or impossibility for the antibiotic to reach an adequate concentration at the site of infection. Alternative reasons are always important to consider before changing or adding new antibiotics.</li>

      <li>Patients who have previously been treated for infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales. In certain settings <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> may be resistant to fosfomycin; therefore, local knowledge of susceptibility profiles for aerobic Gram-negative bacteria is crucial (409). Fosfomycin does not reliably treat <em>Acinetobacter</em> spp. and its activity against <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> is variable.</li>

      <li>Patients who are known to be colonized with carbapenem-resistant pathogens found to be susceptible to fosfomycin.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To help prescribers identify clinical scenarios where empiric use of Reserve antibiotics could exceptionally be considered, suggestions are given in the relevant chapters of the AWaRe book for selected infections (only for infections where empiric use could potentially be adequate on a case-by-case basis).</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Emerging resistance in Enterobacterales</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Cross-resistance is uncommon because of the unique structure and mechanism of action of fosfomycin. Both chromosomal-mediated and plasmid-mediated (i.e. transmissible) resistance can occur. Resistance can rapidly develop in vitro, but in clinical practice resistance is still uncommon, although it is increasing <em>(410)</em>.</p>

    <p>Data on resistance to fosfomycin are currently not reported by the GLASS.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Duration</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Treatment duration varies according to indication and should be as short as possible, usually between 7 and 14 days.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Linezolid is a synthetic antibiotic of the oxazolidinone class which has been in clinical use since the early 2000s for the treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria resistant to other antibiotics. Its current indications in the EML and EMLc include infections caused by MRSA, vancomycin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and vancomycin-resistant <em>Enterococcus</em> spp. and multi-drug resistant <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> <em>(8,9)</em>.</p>

    </figure>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_603" title="603" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Administration</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Linezolid is currently available as a solution for intravenous infusion (2 mg/mL in 300 mL bag) administered by intravenous infusion over 30–120 minutes, and as an oral formulation (tablet: 400 mg; 600 mg). A neonatal or paediatric formulation is also available (powder for oral liquid: 100 mg/5 mL). The high oral bioavailability of linezolid allows initiation with oral treatment as an alternative to intravenous treatment.</p>

    <p>Generic versions of linezolid are available.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Mechanism of action</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Linezolid acts by binding to the 50S unit of the bacterial ribosome, inhibiting the synthesis of bacterial proteins.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Spectrum of activity</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Linezolid is mainly active against aerobic Gram-positive bacteria. In particular against most clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant <em>Enterococcus</em> spp., MRSA and penicillin non-susceptible pneumococci. In addition, linezolid has some bactericidal activity against <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> including extensively drug-resistant strains and certain non-tuberculous mycobacteria.</p>

    <p>Linezolid is not indicated for the treatment of Gram-negative infections. Even though linezolid has some in vitro activity against certain Gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria, clinical data are limited and its use is not recommended for the treatment of these pathogens.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Clinical efficacy</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Several clinical trials have assessed the efficacy and safety of linezolid compared to vancomycin for the treatment of MRSA infections in general <em>(411)</em> and for skin and soft tissue infections in particular, including those caused by MRSA <em>(412)</em>. Linezolid was associated with better short-term survival compared to daptomycin for the treatment of bloodstream infections caused by vancomycin-resistant <em>Enterococcus</em> spp. <em>(413–415)</em>. However, linezolid’s overall superiority to daptomycin is less clear because a large cohort study showed greater treatment failure and short-term mortality with linezolid than daptomycin <em>(416)</em>. With health care-associated pneumonia, the results of a systematic review and meta-analysis did not show a clear benefit of linezolid for clinical cure or microbiological eradication when compared to vancomycin or teicoplanin, and linezolid was associated with more side-effects <em>(417)</em>.</p>

    <p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_604" title="604" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Linezolid can also be used as part of a longer regimen (longer than the standard TB treatment duration) for the treatment of patients with multidrug- and rifampicin-resistant TB as indicated in WHO guidelines for treatment of drug-resistant TB <em>(418)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Toxicity</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Linezolid is generally well tolerated; however, it can cause myelosuppression (mostly thrombocytopenia but also anaemia or leukopenia), which is usually reversible when linezolid is stopped. Therefore, a complete blood cell count should be done weekly, especially in high-risk patients, such as those with pre-existing myelosuppression or concomitant use of medicines that cause bone marrow suppression. As with any other medicine, interactions with other medicines should be checked before prescribing linezolid; this topic is, however, not addressed in the AWaRe book. Severe optic neuropathy can occur rarely, particularly if linezolid is used for more than 28 days. Patients should be advised to report all new visual symptoms. Peripheral neuropathy is also rarely associated with the (prolonged) use of linezolid. The risk of side-effects increases with prolonged use (usually &gt; 4 weeks), which should be avoided unless there are no alternatives.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Dose</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Linezolid does not require dose adjustments in case of renal impairment (Table 45.1). Please also refer to the chapter on dosing for more information.</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Indication for use as a Reserve antibiotic</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Linezolid can be considered in the following situations.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Oral treatment for MRSA is necessary and other less expensive oral alternatives to linezolid are not indicated or are likely to be ineffective due to resistance or toxicity concerns. 

      <ul>
        <li><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_605" title="605" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Oral treatment may be necessary when maintaining access to parenteral treatment is difficult or for switching from intravenous to oral treatment when the patient could be discharged from hospital before the planned treatment course is completed.</li>

        <li>In case of documented hypersensitivity to vancomycin.</li>
      </ul></li>

      <li>In case of severe renal impairment.</li>

      <li>In case of infections caused by vancomycin-resistant <em>Enterococcus</em> spp. or <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>.</li>

      <li>In very select cases of seriously ill patients with invasive infections that are known to be colonized with vancomycin-resistant <em>Enterococcus</em> spp. or <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>.</li>

      <li>As a second-line option for the treatment of mycobacterial infections, including extensively drug-resistant <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> as recommended in WHO guidelines <em>(418)</em>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When using linezolid, the risk of side-effects (mostly thrombocytopenia), especially with prolonged use, should always be taken into account. Because of this and because of the risk of emergence of resistance, linezolid use as Reserve antibiotic should be limited to well defined patient populations and be as short as possible.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Emerging resistance in Gram-positive bacteria</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Resistance to linezolid in usually susceptible Gram-positive bacteria most commonly arises through mutations in the bacterial 23S ribosomal RNA, but it can also be transmitted through plasmids. Resistance can develop in the absence of prior treatment with linezolid and also after short periods of exposure to the antibiotic and should be carefully monitored.</p>

    <p>Resistant isolates of enterococci, staphylococci and streptococci have been reported worldwide but their proportion remains low and in general; most Gram-positive bacteria are still susceptible to linezolid <em>(419)</em>. Selection for resistance could be favoured by suboptimal dosing of the antibiotic, especially in severely ill patients where volumes of distribution may be higher leading to low plasma levels <em>(420)</em>.</p>

    <p>Data on resistance to linezolid are currently not reported by the GLASS.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Duration</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Treatment duration varies according to indication and should be as short as possible. Prolonged treatment (&gt; 4 weeks) should be avoided whenever possible because of increased risk of toxicity (see toxicity section).</p>

        <li class="box_li">Meropenem+vaborbactam has activity against many carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, especially those producing <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> carbapenemases, but not strains producing metallo-beta-lactamases and oxacillinase-48 (OXA-48).</li>

        <li class="box_li">Meropenem+vaborbactam is currently not licenced for use in children.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p class="noindent">Meropenem+vaborbactam is a combination of a carbapenem (meropenem) and a new non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor (vaborbactam). Its current indications in the EML include infections caused by certain strains of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, <em>Acinetobacter baumannii</em> and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> <em>(8)</em>. Its activity varies depending on the type of carbapenemase produced and the resistance mechanism.</p>

    <p>However, for most strains of <em>Acinetobacter baumannii</em> and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, the addition of vaborbactam to meropenem has no additional advantage over meropenem alone because of the presence of different resistance mechanisms. Therefore, activity of meropenem + vaborbactam against these pathogens is limited.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Administration</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Meropenem+vaborbactam is currently available as powder for intravenous infusion (1 g + 1 g in vial). It should be administered by intravenous infusion over 3 hours.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Mechanism of action</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Meropenem+vaborbactam acts by inhibiting bacterial enzymes responsible for cell wall synthesis, primarily penicillin-binding proteins. Vaborbactam targets the site of certain serine beta-lactamases (Ambler class B) and inactivates them, thus protecting meropenem from degradation.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Meropenem+vaborbactam has a broad-spectrum of action including Gram-positive aerobic bacteria, Gram-negative aerobic bacteria and anaerobic bacteria. In particular, vaborbactam inhibits the activity of ESBLs, AmpC beta-lactamases and <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> carbapenemases, and thus preserves the activity of meropenem against many multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (Table 46.1). However, vaborbactam does not inhibit the activity of metallo-beta-lactamases and OXA-48 beta-lactamases and therefore meropenem is not active against strains expressing these beta-lactamases (Table 46.1).</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Clinical efficacy</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">The TANGO I trial demonstrated that the efficacy and safety of meropenem+vaborbactam in adults was non-inferior to piperacillin+tazobactam for the treatment of complicated UTIs <em>(421)</em>. The TANGO II trial (77 patients) demonstrated improved clinical cure and decreased <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_609" title="609" role="doc-pagebreak"/>short-term mortality and nephrotoxicity than the best-available therapy for the treatment of infections caused by proven or suspected carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales <em>(422)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Toxicity</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Meropenem+vaborbactam is well tolerated and has side-effects similar to those previously reported for meropenem alone. However, meropenem+vaborbactam is less damaging to the kidneys than other antibiotics used to treat infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Dose</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Dose adjustments are required in cases of renal impairment (Table 46.2). In children, the optimal dose is unknown because of limited paediatric-specific pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic data <em>(423)</em>.

    <ul>
      <li>As a last-resort option for the targeted treatment of severe infections caused by laboratory-confirmed <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales. It is not indicated in cases of metallo-beta-lactamases and OXA-48 production.</li>

      <li>For treatment of infections caused by bacteria resistant to ceftazidime+avibactam, unless resistance to ceftazidime+avibactam is due to the production of metallo-beta-lactamases.</li>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Empiric treatment</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Meropenem+vaborbactam could be considered for empiric use exceptionally in very select cases of seriously ill patients with invasive infections (e.g. patients with sepsis/septic shock) suspected to be caused by a multidrug-resistant pathogen (e.g. severe hospital-acquired infections or infections in patients who have received multiple antibiotic treatments in the recent past), such as in the following situations.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Plazomicin is a new semisynthetic aminoglycoside derived from sisomicin, an older aminoglycoside <em>(425)</em>. Its current indications in the EML include infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales <em>(8,9)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Administration</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Plazomicin has been developed as injection for intravenous use (500 mg/10 mL). It is administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Mechanism of action</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Plazomicin acts by binding to the 30S unit of the bacterial ribosome, thus inhibiting the start of the synthesis of bacterial proteins.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Plazomicin can be considered as salvage therapy for otherwise untreatable carbapenem- resistant Gram-negative infections.</p>

    <p>Efficacy has been demonstrated only for the treatment of complicated UTIs in adults where plazomicin showed non-inferiority to meropenem <em>(427)</em>.</p>

    <p>Very limited evidence exists for the treatment of other types of infections and for its use in children. Plazomicin has also been compared with colistin as part of combination therapy for the treatment of severe infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, such as bacteraemia and hospital-acquired pneumonia <em>(428)</em>. The results of the study indicated that plazomicin reduced short-term mortality and disease-related complications, but the trial was stopped early because of major difficulties with enrolling patients. The study therefore provides only descriptive statistics and findings; as such its results are inconclusive.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Toxicity</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Plazomicin can cause damage to the kidneys and ears, similar to other aminoglycosides. The risk of nephrotoxicity is higher in older patients (&gt; 65 years) and in patients with pre-existing renal impairment; therefore, creatinine levels should be monitored regularly.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Dose</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Weight-based, once-daily dosing is used (Table 47.2). Dose adjustments are required in cases of renal impairment. No paediatric dosing is currently available. Please also refer to the chapter on dosing for more information.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>An important advantage of plazomicin is that it only needs to be given once a day, while other Reserve antibiotics that have a comparable spectrum of activity require multiple daily doses.</li>

        <li>To preserve its effectiveness (i.e. to prevent the development of resistance), it should not be used to treat Enterobacterales isolates that only produce ESBLs when other choices are available.</li>
      </ul></li>

      <li>For infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria resistant to other aminoglycosides such as gentamicin or amikacin if non-Reserve antibiotic options cannot be used.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Empiric treatment</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Plazomicin could be considered for empiric use exceptionally in very select cases of seriously ill patients with invasive infections (e.g. patients with sepsis/septic shock caused by infections of the urinary tract if used as monotherapy; in other situations, plazomicin, like other aminoglycosides, would most likely be used in combination with other antibiotics) suspected to be caused by a multidrug-resistant pathogen (e.g. severe hospital-acquired infections or infections in patients who have received multiple antibiotic treatments in the recent past), such as in the following situations.</p>

    <p>To help prescribers identify clinical situations where empiric use of Reserve antibiotics could exceptionally be considered, suggestions are given in the relevant chapters of the AWaRe book for selected infections (only for infections where empiric use could potentially be adequate on a case-by-case basis).</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Emerging resistance in Enterobacterales</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">The main mechanisms of resistance overlap with some of those for other aminoglycosides. In particular, ribosomal modifications of the target site within the ribosome can prevent plazomicin from binding to its target, and alterations to uptake and efflux pumps can decrease the antibiotic concentration at the site of action. However, unlike other aminoglycosides, plazomicin maintains activity against most aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes – enzymes that can reduce the affinity of the antibiotic for its ribosomal target through a mechanism that is different from ribosomal modifications. Plasmid-mediated resistance (i.e. transmissible resistance) has also been described.</p>

    <p>Data on resistance to plazomicin are currently not reported by the GLASS.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Duration</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Polymyxin B and colistin are polypeptides belonging to the polymyxin class of antibiotics. These antibiotics became available for clinical use in the 1960s but were replaced by other classes because of their unfavourable safety profile, notably nephrotoxicity. They have, however, been rediscovered in recent years because they retain activity against many strains of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, including carbapenemase-producing strains. Polymyxin B and colistin have very similar chemical structures; however, polymyxin B is administered directly as the active antibiotic, while colistin is administered as inactive prodrug (sodium salt of colistin methane sulfonate also known as colistimethate). Since colistimethate is produced by chemical modification of colistin molecules through addition of methanesulfonate moieties, there are many different partially methanesulfonated derivatives in a given product, which results in batch-to-batch (and brand-to-brand) variation of the exact composition. Furthermore, there is important patient-to-patient variation in the metabolism of colistimethate, making the pharmacokinetics of colistin difficult to predict <em>(429)</em>.</p>

    <p>The current indications for polymyxins B and colistin in the EML and EMLc include infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, <em>Acinetobacter baumannii</em> and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> <em>(8,9)</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_620" title="620" role="doc-pagebreak"/><strong>Administration</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Polymyxin B and colistin are available as powder for intravenous injection formulations (polymyxin B: 500 000 IU in vial; colistin: 1 million IU (as colistemethate sodium) in vial). They are administered by intravenous infusion over 60 to 90 minutes. There are important geographical differences in the availability of these antibiotics; polymyxin B, for example, is not available in many countries. The oral non-absorbable formulation of colistin (colistin sulfate) is not currently included in the EML and EMLc <em>(8,9)</em> and therefore is not covered in this chapter.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Mechanism of action</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Polymyxin B and colistin act by disrupting the bacterial cell membrane through interaction with lipopolysaccharides present in the membranes of Gram-negative bacteria which thus leads to cell lysis. However, the exact mechanism is unknown.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Spectrum of activity</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Polymyxin B and colistin have the same antibacterial spectrum and both are active only against aerobic Gram-negative bacteria with no activity against anaerobes, Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative cocci, for example, <em>Neisseria</em> spp.. Polymyxins are active against many clinical isolates of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, <em>Acinetobacter</em> spp. and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, including many of the isolates producing carbapenemases (Table 48.1).</p>

    <h2 class="h2a sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Clinical efficacy</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Polymyxin B and colistin can be considered as salvage therapy for otherwise untreatable infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.</p>

    <p>For severe infections, they are usually given as part of combination therapy often with high doses of carbapenems (but only if the minimum inhibitory concentration of carbapenems is ≤ 8–16 mg/L) or in combination with other antibiotics depending on the type of infection and in vitro susceptibility <em>(430)</em>.</p>

    <p>However, the only currently available randomized clinical trial did not show that combination therapy was superior to colistin monotherapy for short-term clinical success – at least for infections caused by extensively drug-resistant <em>Acinetobacter</em> spp. It is unclear whether this also applies to carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales <em>(431)</em>. Evidence from observational studies is available but should be interpreted with caution due to the inherent methodological limitations <em>(432,433)</em>.</p>

    <p>Polymyxin B and colistin were approved for use decades ago and were therefore not subjected to the same development process that would be required for the approval of a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_622" title="622" role="doc-pagebreak"/>new antibiotic today. This point should be kept in mind when interpreting data about their efficacy and safety, for example, current products of polymyxins may be less nephrotoxic than those initially used <em>(434)</em>. There are recently licensed Reserve group beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations (ceftazidime+avibactam, meropenem+vaborbactam) or siderophore-antibiotics (cefiderocol) available that some experts consider preferable to polymyxins because of their better safety profile and potentially better efficacy. However, the evidence of their superiority is weak and access and affordability of these new antibiotics is a major issue in many low- and middle-income settings.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Toxicity</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">The use of polymyxin B and colistin can cause kidney damage (colistin is more likely to cause damage than polymyxin B) and, more rarely, neurotoxicity (e.g. paraesthesia). The side-effects are reversible in most cases and are associated with the cumulative dose and duration of therapy and use of concomitant medicines with similar toxicities.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Dose</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Great care must be taken to avoid dosing errors with polymyxin B and colistin (Table 48.2 and Table 48.3). Errors can arise because doses can be given in different units on labels <em>(435–437)</em>.</p>

    <p>Polymyxin B doses can be given in international units (IU) or milligrams. For example, a dose of 1 million IU corresponds to 100 mg.</p>

    <p>Colistin doses can be given in: IU of colistimethate sodium; mg of colistimethate sodium; or mg of colistin base activity. For example, a dose of 1 million IU of colistimethate sodium corresponds to 80 mg of colistimethate sodium and to 34 mg of colistin base activity.</p>

    <p>When using polymyxins, it is crucial to start therapy with a loading dose followed by maintenance dose after 12–24 hours. The reason is to more rapidly achieve plasma concentrations that may be effective. In addition, for colistin (but not for polymyxin B), dose adjustments are necessary in cases of renal impairment <em>(438)</em>.</p>

    <p>Few data are available for dosing in children. Current evidence suggests that doses approved by regulatory agencies may be suboptimal for many children due to interpatient variability <em>(438)</em>.</p>

    <p>Please also refer to the chapter on dosing for more information.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Polymyxin B or colistin could be considered, usually as part of a combination therapy, as a last-resort option for the targeted treatment of severe infections caused by laboratory-confirmed carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, including infections caused by carbapenemase-producing strains that have been found to be susceptible to these antibiotics.</p>

    <p>If available, polymyxin B is usually preferred to colistin because it has better pharmacokinetic characteristics and less potential to cause kidney damage.</p>

    <p>The only situation where the use of colistin is preferred is for the treatment of UTIs because colistin reaches higher concentrations in urine compared to polymyxin B. The prodrug colistimethate is excreted primarily by the kidneys, while polymyxin B is mainly eliminated through non-renal pathways; however the fraction of colistimethate being converted to colistin in the urine remains unclear <em>(439)</em>.</p>

    <h3 class="h3b sigil_not_in_toc">Empiric treatment</h3>

    <p class="noindent">Polymyxin B or colistin should only be considered for empiric use exceptionally in selected cases of seriously ill patients with invasive infections (e.g. patients with sepsis/septic shock) suspected to be caused by a multidrug-resistant pathogen (e.g. severe hospital-acquired infections or infections in patients who have received multiple antibiotic treatments in the recent past), such as in the following situations.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Patients who have not responded to carbapenems if other causes of treatment failure have been excluded first and there is a strong suspicion that the infection is caused by a carbapenem-resistant pathogen. However, if a patient is not improving, antibiotic failure is not the only possible cause to consider. Alternative reasons include for example: alternative diagnosis, development of complications (e.g. an abscess), inadequate source control, sub-optimal dose of the antibiotic or impossibility for the antibiotic to reach an adequate concentration at the site of infection. Alternative reasons are always important to consider before changing or adding new antibiotics.</li>

      <li>Patients who have previously been treated for infections caused by carbapenem-resistant pathogens susceptible to polymyxins.</li>

      <li>Patients who are known to be colonized with carbapenem-resistant pathogens found to be susceptible to polymyxins.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_625" title="625" role="doc-pagebreak"/>To help prescribers identify clinical scenarios where empiric use of Reserve antibiotics could exceptionally be considered, suggestions are given in the relevant chapters of the AWaRe book for selected infections (only for infections where empiric use could potentially be adequate on a case-by-case basis).</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Emerging resistance in Enterobacterales, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> and <em>Acinetobacter baumannii</em></strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Some technical challenges exist to identify resistance to polymyxin B and colistin. For example, polymyxins diffuse poorly in diffusion-based assays, such as disk-diffusion tests. Broth microdilution, which is the recommended method, is impractical and rarely used in most laboratories <em>(440)</em>. Resistance can be related to chromosomal mutations that lead to changes in the bacterial membrane that impair the ability of polymyxin B and colistin to bind to their target. Plasmid-mediated resistance (i.e. transmissible resistance) due to mobilized colistin resistance (mcr) genes is also being increasingly described <em>(441,442)</em>.</p>

    <p>Data on resistance to colistin and polymyxin B are currently not reported by the GLASS.</p>

    <h2 class="h2b sigil_not_in_toc"><strong>Duration</strong></h2>

    <p class="noindent">Treatment duration varies according to indication and should be as short as possible, usually between 7 and 14 days.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Table 50.1 lists the antibiotics and suggested doses to be used in children for the conditions covered in the AWaRe book.</p>

    <p>For children, weight-based dosing is used for oral treatment when possible. The 2019 EML report on consensus guidance on paediatric antibiotic dosing regimens was used as a reference but adapted and weight-banded by infection and severity of disease <em>(20)</em>. Local and national dosing guidance should be considered where available.</p>
